    <h2>"Rick is running to take our country back"</h2>
    <p>One of seven children, Rick Weiland is a fifth generation South Dakotan who was born and raised in Madison and graduated from the University of South Dakota. Weiland and his wife of 32 years, Stacy, own and operate small businesses in Sioux Falls.</p>

    <p>Rick is running so that we can take our country back from the big money that controls our economy and democracy. He wants to stop the sweetheart deals and bailouts that cause waste in government. He believes that every family, farmer, rancher and working person in South Dakota deserves an even playing field. Instead of giving tax breaks to millionaires and big corporations that ship our jobs overseas, he will fight to increase the minimum wage, invest in education, and fight to protect and expand Social Security and Medicare.</p>

    <p>Rick is a former Regional Director for FEMA, where he supervised responses to natural disasters, and he served as the South Dakota Director for the AARP.</p>
