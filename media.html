###[Huffington Post: Silicon Valley CEOs Get A Warm Washington Welcome To Politics](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/10/20/mayday-pac-upton_n_6016028.html)
> Silicon Valley executives who gave big money to a super PAC have received angry calls from a top aide to one of its targets, as well as calls from the targeted congressman himself, sources familiar with the situation told The Huffington Post.

###[Concord Monitor: Editorial - GOP should Choose Rubens for Senate](http://www.concordmonitor.com/home/13333938-95/editorial-gop-should-choose-rubens-for-senate)
> Scott Brown may be dominating the headlines and the airwaves in the GOP’s quest to unseat Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen. But Jim Rubens is the candidate who offers New Hampshire Republicans the clearest view of where he stands and where the party should be going.

> The Rubens campaign is also being supported by the bipartisan Mayday PAC, which aims to help elect candidates who are likely to push for campaign finance reform. The rising influence of money in politics has an ever-tightening grip on both parties, and it’s a hopeful sign to have a candidate who is serious about meaningful reform.

> I calculated the number of relevant funders in American politics today; it’s something like 150,000 Americans, which is about the same number of people named Lester in the United States. 

> When I say this statistic, it sort of shocks people, but it’s important to keep this in mind: When Ronald Reagan ran for reelection, he attended eight fundraisers. When Obama ran for reelection, he attended 228 fundraisers



###[Re/Code: Tech-Funded PAC’s Race for Legitimacy Runs Through New Hampshire](http://recode.net/2014/08/26/tech-funded-pacs-race-for-legitimacy-runs-through-new-hampshire/)
> Jim Rubens is an unlikely political savior, but the tech-funded Mayday PAC is betting the unknown New Hampshire Republican can pull off a miracle.

> Mayday’s focus on New Hampshire and Iowa — both states that hold early, influential presidential primaries — is a deliberate attempt to get campaign finance reform on the radar screens of local activists



###[Vice: Jim Rubens and the Lonely Republican Crusade to Get Money Out Politics](http://www.vice.com/read/meet-jim-rubens-the-unlikely-republican-who-wants-to-get-money-out-of-politics)
> Rubens appears to be bridging the gap between right- and left-wing populism. Last month, Mayday PAC, the “anti-Super PAC Super PAC," …pledg[ed] to spend upward of $1 million on his primary campaign against Brown.



###[Monadnock Ledger-Transcript: ‘Paying it backward’](http://www.ledgertranscript.com/home/13274621-95/paying-it-backward)
> Lessig said New Hampshire has a “unique opportunity to set the tone and progress” for the 2016 presidential elections. New Hampshire’s Republican primary election is on Sept. 9.

> On Saturday, when asked about what New Hampshire can do in the upcoming elections in September and November, Lessig said the public can ask “tough questions” and support candidates who are for reforming the system. If these candidates sweep the elections, Lessig said, that will carry over to the 2016 presidential election. New Hampshire has the first presidential primary in the nation.


###[Politico Magazine: The PAC to End All PACs Is a Farce](http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/08/the-pac-to-end-all-pacs-is-a-failure-110329_Page2.html#ixzz3BVbXxOj3)
> Oddly enough, Gallego’s website does not highlight campaign reform as one of his major issues, although if you stare hard enough you can find a small link to his support for a federal matching-fund program for small donations

> Even though Mayday PAC has not yet started advertising on behalf of Shea-Porter, she unquestionably measures up to Lessig’s criteria. Her campaign website, for example, lists “Campaign Finance Reform” as her top issue as she details her backing for measures ranging from full disclosure of Super PAC donors to public financing of campaigns.



###[TheINDsider.com: Lessig inveighs against money in politics at Top 50](http://www.theind.com/news/indreporter/18665-lessig-inveighs-against-money-in-politics-at-top-50)
> There are 144,000 people in the United States named Lester — or .05 percent. That’s also the percentage of affluent Americans who gave the maximum amount allowed to a federal candidate — hence Lesterland equals the American federal election system.

> It’s a conceit used by Harvard Law School professor Lawrence Lessig in a book, in well-received TED Talks and, this week, in the keynote address at the annual ABiz Top 50 Luncheon held in the Cajundome Convention Center. Lessig’s message: money corrupts the electoral process and it’s past time for regular citizens to reclaim the power.



###[NJ.com: Opinion: Anti-corruption act takes hold in Princeton as MayDay PAC provides hope](http://www.nj.com/opinion/index.ssf/2014/08/opinion_1.html)
> With $12 million raised and matched, the MayDay PAC has launched a test this summer to win at least five and, perhaps, as many as eight congressional races in 2014. Its initial goal was five races – two Republican candidates and three Democrats all pledged to reform campaign finance laws. 

> In Princeton, the council’s resolution calls upon the 12th Congressional District representative and the 16th District state legislators to support and introduce anti-corruption legislation to the U.S. House of Representatives and in the Statehouse, respectively.



###[SF Gate: Tech mogul tackles 'dark money' in political campaigns](http://www.sfgate.com/politics/joegarofoli/article/Tech-mogul-tackles-dark-money-in-political-5704914.php)
> Some other tech-inspired reform ideas are catching fire, like one led by longtime Stanford Professor Lawrence Lessig, who is now teaching at Harvard. This year Lessig started the Mayday PAC, which he described as a "citizen-funded, kick-started super PAC to end all super PACs."

> Lessig has talked about reforming the role of money in Congress for nearly a decade - even exploring a Silicon Valley run for the House in 2008. He's finally got traction with Mayday, raising $7.8 million from more than 55,000 individuals since launching - including an endorsement from Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak. 



###[Concord Monitor: Mayday PAC releases satirical ad in support of U.S. Senate candidate Jim Rubens](http://www.concordmonitor.com/news/politics/13230878-95/mayday-pac-releases-satirical-ad-in-support-of-us-senate-candidate-jim-rubens)
> The Mayday PAC, a group aiming to get big money out of politics, released its first television ad in support of U.S. Senate candidate Jim Rubens. And it recruited the satirical candidate “Honest Gil” to do it.

> “You see me and my buddy, Scott Brown, we want to take your tax dollars and hand them out to the cronies and lobbyists who bankroll our political campaigns,” Fulbright says. “But this Jim Rubens guy, he wants to stop corruption in Washington. He thinks it’s his job to help the people of New Hampshire.”



###[Politico: ‘Honest Gil’ this New Hampshire airwaves](http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2014/08/21/super-pacs-take-aim-scott-brown/wyyMDzKDLMkCHXbnq2QaTP/story.html?p1=ArticleTab_Article_Bottom)
> Also on the attack: Mayday PAC, a super PAC aimed at ending super PACs and reducing the influence of money in politics. It’s set to start airing a strange TV ad on Friday boosting one of Brown’s longshot GOP opponents, former state senator Jim Rubens, ahead of the Sept. 9 New Hampshire primary.

> The PAC, launched by Harvard Law School professor, author, and activist Lawrence Lessig, is supporting both Democratic and Republican candidates this cycle. The group is “working to fundamental change the way elections are funded” said a spokeswoman, Allison Bryan.



###[Boston Globe: Super PACs take aim at N.H. Senate hopeful Scott Brown](http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2014/08/21/super-pacs-take-aim-scott-brown/wyyMDzKDLMkCHXbnq2QaTP/story.html?p1=ArticleTab_Article_Bottom)

> The satirical Senate candidate, who also made an appearance earlier this year in Kentucky, is pretending to run for office under the banner of the anti-corruption group Represent.Us. He will appear in a television ad airing across New Hampshire starting this Friday.

> The ads are funded by MayDay PAC, an organization which backs campaign finance reform. Last month, MayDay PAC endorsed former New Hampshire state Sen. Jim Rubens over former Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown in the state's upcoming GOP Senate primary.



###[Valley News Editorial: Fight Money With Money — Rubens Bucks a Political Trend](http://www.vnews.com/home/12138248-95/editorial-fight-money-with-money-rubens-bucks-a-political-trend)
> Mayday is backing Rubens because he supports campaign finance reform. A New York Times story noted that he favors giving voters a $50 tax rebate check every two years to be spent on candidate contributions. He has also called for a searchable database of contributions...

> Rubens is correct about the public’s disgust with the money virus that has infected our democracy. The cure won’t be easy, since, as the Times noted, Republican leaders such as Sen. Mitch McConnell and conservative legal scholars “deeply oppose’’ proposals that would restrict money in campaigns, “arguing that they are an infringement on free speech and healthy political competition.”



###[The Conway Daily Sun: U.S. Senate candidates talk money in politics](http://www.conwaydailysun.com/newsx/local-news/115879-u-s-senate-candidates-talk-money-in-politics)
> Republican candidates for U.S. Senate shared their thoughts on the influence of money in politics with a reporter at the end of last week's debate in North Conway.

> Mayday.us asks people to "embrace the irony" in their message. When asked about the race, Lessig said the important question is if a candidate has "committed to fundamental reform." "Shaheen and Rubens have," said Lessig. "Brown and Smith have not. That's why we've endorsed Rubens in the GOP primary."



###[Think Progress: Can A SuperPAC Really End All SuperPACs?](http://thinkprogress.org/election/2014/08/19/3472597/superpac-mayday-end-superpacs/)
> A 2012 poll found nearly 7 in 10 Americans would prefer that super PACs — political committees that can raise and spend unlimited sums of money for or against federal candidates — were banned entirely.

> “To us, we’ll be looking for how we moved the dial between before our intervention and after and whether we can show through the data that a significant proportion of that movement was because of us. We’re creating the conditions to make that possible, by having the right kind of data collected, the right kind of ongoing process to do that,” Lessig observed.



###[Huffington Post: Money in Politics: Rising in Intensity as a 2014 Election Issue](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mike-lux/money-in-politics-rising_b_5686326.html?utm_hp_ref=politics)
> There is more and more evidence that Democrats and progressives are discovering the power of taking on big money in politics as a central issue in their campaign strategies

> These kinds of grassroots videos are the latest sign that candidates all over the country, in red states as well as purple and blue, are taking up the fight against money in politics



###[National Journal: Why One PAC Is Succeeding at Fighting Money in Politics Where Others Fell Short](http://www.nationaljournal.com/politics/why-one-pac-is-succeeding-at-fighting-money-in-politics-where-others-fell-short-20140814)
> Much of the coverage of Mayday PAC treats its core idea as though it is entirely novel. It's not. Mayday is just one of the latest initiatives to join a burgeoning coalition that is collectively hacking away at what its advocates see as big money's corrosive effects on democracy.

> "I'm fortunately picking this up at a point in time when America is really ripe to do something," Lessig says. "If I were doing this five years ago, there would be two orders of magnitude difference in the pickup from the very same message. So, yes, I'm doing my part, but I'm doing my part in the middle of a tinderbox. It doesn't take much to get people going on this."

> A new well-funded political action committee that advocates for campaign finance reform has endorsed Democratic U.S. Rep. Carol Shea-Porter's re-election campaign and has begun spending money to back up their endorsement of Republican U.S. Senate candidate Jim Rubens.

> The endorsement of Shea-Porter may end up being a bigger deal. While Rubens has a lot of ground to make up in his Republican primary, Shea-Porter is in a big fight for re-election.



###[News Observer: Mayday PAC endorses Rep. Walter Jones](http://www.newsobserver.com/2014/08/11/4065394/mayday-pac-endorses-rep-walter.html#storylink=cpy)

> The Mayday PAC, a super PAC created to get big money out of politics, announced it will jump into a second New Hampshire race. The group said yesterday it will back U.S. Rep. Carol Shea-Porter, a Democrat, in her re-election bid against Republican Frank Guinta because she has co-sponsored bills that aim to reform campaign finance practices.



###[New Hampshire Public Radio: Shea-Porter Gets PAC Money For Opposing PAC Money](http://nhpr.org/post/shea-porter-gets-pac-money-opposing-pac-money)

> The Mayday PAC received a lot more media attention than most political action committees when itburst onto the political scene this past spring. Created by Harvard law professor Lawrence Lessig, the PAC was dubbed the "Super PAC to End Super PACs" for its unique goal to fund political candidates who are fighting to reduce to influence of money in politics.

>  On Monday the Mayday PAC announced three candidates that they feel fit the bill of the campaign finance reformers we've all been waiting for.



###[Reuters: Lawrence Lessig’s Mayday PAC endorses three House candidates](http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/08/11/us-usa-politics-pac-idUSKBN0GB1O920140811)

> ... incumbents Rep. Walter Jones (R—N.C.) and Rep. Carol Shea-Porter (D—N.H.), and Ruben Gallego, a Democrat running for his party’s nomination in Arizona’s 7th congressional district



###[Sunlight Foundation: Questions remain for Mayday PAC](http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2014/07/22/questions-remain-for-mayday-pac/)
>  The group's founders want to stamp out corruption of the campaign finance system, starting with five races in the midterm elections. The goal is to elect candidates committed to campaign finance reform, regardless of party.

> From what we have seen in the group's FEC report, Mayday has had some success in attracting small dollar contributions. Of the $2,091,015 in itemized contributions it received from April through June, $481,269.88 came from donors who gave less than $1,000 total. An additional $1.2 million came from donors who gave less than $200. None of the itemized money came from other PACs or corporations.

>  The Mayday Super PAC, which is bankrolling pro-campaign finance reform candidates and targeting those it sees as barriers to change, recently gave politicians the chance to “inoculate” themselves from the PAC’s wrath by pledging to support reform. Not many took the medicine.

> Just 35 of the roughly 2,500 candidates running for House and Senate seats in 2014 (many of the 2,500 are not serious contenders) made the Mayday PAC pledge to support at least one proposal to substantially change the way campaigns are financed...

>  As bad as it is, Lawrence Lessig has no reservations about using a bad, unjust — some say corrupt — campaign finance system to change the way campaigns are funded.

> So Mayday is using the rules that allow super PACs to raise unlimited sums of money from corporations, unions, associations and individuals and spend it to overtly advocate for or against political candidates, to test its message and strategy in a handful of races this year. Among them is the open seat Iowa 3rd Congressional District race where Mayday is backing Democrat Staci Appel.

>  Mayday PAC, which was started by Harvard law professor Lawrence Lessig this spring, has amassed an arsenal of $12 million that it plans to use to bolster five congressional candidates who have committed to backing measures that elevate small donors. 

> The boomlet in anti-big-money super PACs comes as Democrats have sought to make the influence of wealthy individuals on politics a prominent issue in this year’s elections. While the issue animates the liberal base, it remains to be seen how the new groups will demonstrate their impact amid a deluge of political spending.

>  Embrace the irony. That's the slogan of a new super PAC that has budgeted $2 million to spend in Iowa's 3rd Congressional District race. It's a special-interest organization, but Mayday PAC is not like others lined up to influence voters.

>  Today Lessig announced the first two candidates who will receive support from the Mayday PAC. The choices illustrate just how difficult it is to find credible Republican candidates who will support public financing of elections.

> His campaign needs broad bipartisan support if it's going to overcome the entrenched interests opposing publicly-financed elections. And Rubens may have been the most promising Republican candidate the Mayday PAC could find.

>  The groups want to create common ground between liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans who agree that big money has become a problem in campaigns. Mayday PAC will back candidates of either party that support reducing the influence of major donors.

> Mayday and other PACS such as Every Voice— which will work the issue on the state level— is not seeking to restrict spending but rather promoting ways to prompt more small donors to enter the fray and in this way lessen the impact of big contributors.

>  Mayday PAC, which seeks to reform campaign finance by promoting candidates of either party who will support reform legislation to end the overwhelming influence of PAC money in U.S. elections, is faced with the challenge of walking a tightrope in choosing precisely which candidates it will support in 2014.

> In short, with its decision to back Iowa's Appel, Mayday has given liberals some reason to smile upon it. But then there's the little matter of Mayday's other Anointed One, New Hampshire Republican Jim Rubens.

> With more than 50,000 contributors, the average donation works out to about $140. No matter what side you're on when it comes to campaign finance, this was a triumph of grassroots organizing, with small donations leading the way.

> First it has to convince people that campaign finance is an issue worth voting on at all. Then it has to persuade people to vote its way.

> But the latest campaign finance push, however impractical or constitutionally suspect, has tapped a well of voter anger that politicians ignore at their peril. Public disgust with Congress, which according to Gallup now enjoys a record-low 7 percent approval rating

> Some campaign finance experts cast the uphill amendment drive as an ill-advised distraction from more pragmatic changes. Lessig’s Mayday PAC, for one, is focused not on amending the Constitution but on such changes as matching small-dollar donations with public funding

Still, given the difficulty of finding Republicans who are willing to commit to genuine campaign finance reform, it seems likely that Mayday would mostly support Democrats.

> Lessig...met the first hurdle this week when he raised $12 million for his ‘PAC to end all PACS.’ Now he has to show the campaign can elect politicians who will effectively confront the problem. The plan is for the tactic to grow in the next election after testing it in 2014.

> Lessig, who has far less campaign experience than Rove, needs to win a lot more races while spending a lot less money than American Crossroads. And for his plan to work — for 2014 to be the proof of concept Lessig needs for the massive push he envisions in 2016 — he needs to win those races convincingly.

> The candidates selected will need to take a position on hard issues, like the five outlined at reform.to, which provide concrete plans to create a small donor system for campaign financing: matching citizen contributions and providing voters with vouchers.

> Lessig explained that candidates will be held accountable by committing to co-sponsoring a reform on campaign finance. The reason, said Lessig, is “if you get a majority of members [of Congress] who sponsor a piece of legislation, you have a tool to leverage that legislation on the floor."



###[ON the Media (RADIO INTERIVEW): The Super PAC to End Super PACs](http://www.onthemedia.org/story/super-pac-end-super-pacs/)

> Long story short: the color of Mayday's small-online-donor money is distinctly blue. Actually, this may not be too surprising a result (though it's still worth quantifying): I suspect liberals today tend to feel persecuted by PACs, and probably for good reason, whereas conservatives tend to like rampant big-money-in-politics just fine, thank you very much.

> Pushing back against this possibility is MaydayPAC, founded by Harvard Law School professor, author and long-time activist Lawrence Lessig.



###[Motherboard: Five Candidates the Internet's Favorite Super PAC Should Spend Its Money On](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/five-candidates-the-internets-favorite-super-pac-should-spend-its-money-on)
> Mayday PAC explicitly says it wants to select five races that are tight enough so that it can claim that its campaign finance reform agenda made an impact. That's where things get tricky. For one thing, most Congressional races aren't even competitive, as Derek Willis notes at The Upshot, and the vast majority of incumbents win reelection. For another, campaign finance reform is not top-of-mind when most voters go to the polls...

> Lessig wants to change that.

> Politics and money always have been cozy together, but in this new unregulated era, the politics of money may well reign over the politics of the many. We face the prospect of government becoming a vehicle of the wealthy donor class. The inequalities of our economy, which we accept as necessary for capitalism, could become the standard of our democracy.

> The Mayday PAC (mayone.us) is a bold new experiment. Launched May 1, the first-round goal was to raise $1 million from ordinary Americans in one month. Nearly 13,000 individuals contributed more than $1 million in 13 days.

Of course, we don’t live in a single-party state that filters candidates for mock elections, but we do have a filter; a hidden primary where our influence is anything but equal.

In response, Lessig transformed his career, ending the work on Internet law that had made him famous and turning his sights on the impossible-seeming fight against money in politics.

> On this wrenching, fascinating episode of The Good Fight, Lessig tells his story, lays out his plan, and explains how Mayday emerged from the desperation Lessig felt after Aaron Swartz’s tragic suicide in 2013.

> In an irony-laden crowdsourcing venture called Mayday, web entrepreneurs including Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, Paypal co-founder Peter Thiel and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffmann are hoping to solve the “big money problem” in US politics.

> “In 2012, 132 Americans funded 60 per cent of the Super PAC money raised in that election cycle,” Lessig said. “That number will go up in 2014. Imagine it goes up by a factor of 250. Even then, the funders of these Super PACs will represent no more than .01 per cent of America.

Let’s not forget the industry’s role in some major super PACs, such as Mark Zuckerberg’s FWD.us. And Napster co-founder Sean Parker has been making large political donations for years.

###[Newsweek: Mayday PAC - The Super PAC Built to Destroy Super PACs](http://www.newsweek.com/new-super-pac-aims-bring-down-super-pacs-256003)
> According to Lessig, Silicon Valley is uniquely positioned to change the power of wealth in American politics. Unlike the finance or energy industries, Silicon Valley has yet to mature to the point where it seeks to boost profit through legislative reforms.

> In some sense, Mayday’s approach seems paradoxical: taking money from one major industry and pitting it against another (the devil you know, and all that). But as Lessig points out, Mayday isn’t aimed specifically at pro-Silicon Valley legislation, like that pertaining to visas or net neutrality. “That wouldn’t be a very principled or interesting PAC,” he says. “The only thing the Mayday PAC is trying to do is get legislation passed to change the way elections are funded.”

Lessig said, “members of Congress were like, ‘What the hell? Why am I here? I didn’t want to become a telemarkter.’”

> In fact, Lessig says this is why the latest Congress has been the most unproductive of our history, because while it is very difficult to pass legislation, it can be very easy to block it. The corruption doesn’t come in these legislators writing bills for their donors – that’s what lobbyists do – it is in their ability to block legislation their donors don’t like.

###[Talking Points Memo: Launching A Super PAC To Fight Super PACs](http://talkingpointsmemo.com/cafe/launching-a-super-pac-to-fight-super-pacs)
> The core problem with our democracy today is that we have outsourced the funding of campaigns to the tiniest fraction of the 1 percent. As congressmen spend between 30 and 70 percent of their time raising campaign cash, they focus their efforts on no more than 150,000 Americans.

> The cost of the 2014 pilot was estimated at $12 million. And so on May 1, we launched an experiment to see whether we could raise money through a Kickstarter campaign for at least half. We set an initial goal of $1 million in 30 days. Insiders thought this was impossible, but with the help of 13,000 supporters, with a median contribution of just $50, we crossed the $1 million mark in 13, not 30, days.

> The story of how a young programmer named Aaron Swartz convinced celebrated academic Lawrence Lessig that no political progress could be made without first reforming campaign finance is now part of Silicon Valley lore. In May, Lessig launched a radical initiative to address the issue: MAYDAY, a SuperPAC that secured funding from two Silicon Valley billionaires in order to curtail the influence of big money.

> "It makes me sick to imagine the amount of time [presidential candidates] spend raising money, but the institutional [issue] we have to do something about quite dramatically is Congress. Because Congress is increasingly an institution that spends all of its time in the business of raising money as opposed to the business of trying to figure out what the right thing to do is."



###[Policy Innovations: Of Moonshots and Slingshots](http://www.policyinnovations.org/ideas/commentary/data/000282)
> Is it still possible for a government to move against the market to favor society? The May Day PAC established by Lawrence Lessig takes the stance that U.S. electoral politics are entirely controlled by corporate interests due to the realities of campaign financing: Politicians who do not attract lavish spending by corporations and wealthy individuals simply cannot succeed under the current rules.

> The situation may be considerably more complex than that (the Republican-Democrat split in America is as much cultural as political), but legitimate questions can certainly be asked about the ability of the U.S. government to go against U.S. business interests.

> This is the fair but hard question raised by the strategy planned by Senate Democrats this summer to force a vote on New Mexico Senator Tom Udall’s proposed constitutional amendment to give Congress the power “to regulate the raising and spending of money” in elections. Forty-three Senate Democrats have cosponsored the resolution. Zero Republicans have. Zero is the same number of Republicans who have joined any of the proposed constitutional amendments now floating about in Congress to, as they are described, “reverse Citizens United.”

> This week, Salon called up Lessig in order to discuss some of the details of the Mayday PAC and the vexing problem of money and democracy in America more generally. We also touched on Eric Cantor’s recent shocking defeat and how inequality causes political polarization. Our conversation is below and has been edited for clarity and length.

> The aim of the super PAC is to win a Congress committed to fundamental reform by 2016. Fundamental reform in the way elections are funded. To do that, we want to run a pilot in 2014 in five districts to demonstrate that this issue matters to voters and to put Congress on notice in 2016 that we’ll be back in a much bigger way.

###[Seacoast Online: We voters have more power than we realize](http://www.seacoastonline.com/articles/20140614-OPINION-406140305)
> Be encouraged! Even though 96 percent of voters agree that money is a problem in politics (they're right), 91 percent don't believe it can be fixed (they're wrong). We voters have more power than we think we do! On Tuesday, a congressional primary race in Virginia was won by a newcomer to politics who raised just over $200,000 for his campaign. His losing opponent (the incumbent) raised over $5 million.

> In his book "Republic, Lost: How Money Corrupts Congress — and a Plan to Stop It," Lawrence Lessig proposes nonpartisan plans to end it. It's a 300-page book, but let me wet your appetite with one paragraph from page 266. "First, we convert the first $50 dollars that each of us contributes to the Federal Treasury into a voucher. Call it a 'democracy voucher.' Each voter is free to allocate his or her democracy voucher as he or she wishes. Maybe $50 to a single candidate. Maybe $25 each to two candidates. Maybe $10 each to five candidates. The only requirement is that the candidate receiving the voucher must opt into the system.



###[Huffington Post: To End School Shootings, Tackle Government Corruption](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/charlotte-hill/to-end-school-shootings-gun-control_b_5489209.html)

I'm not talking about "money exchanged under the table" corruption, but rather what Harvard Professor Larry Lessig terms "dependence corruption" -- the totally legal dependence that our elected officials have upon the powerful interests that make (and, crucially, break) their campaigns.

> This is the cold, hard reality: Any member of Congress who supports gun control legislation today faces a tidal wave of NRA money aimed squarely at kicking them out of office. In the 2012 federal election cycle, the NRA spent nearly $20 million to defeat politicians -- both Democrats and Republicans -- who voted in favor of gun regulations, and to elect politicians who championed unfettered access to guns.

> Larry Lessig's MAYDAY.US. And, yes, we already wrote about this at the beginning of May when the first phase launched, and again when it hit the $1 million goal -- and then secured the second million in matching funds. However, the project has now moved into phase two, where the goal is to raise (and match) $5 million, instead of just $1 million. Already it's around half a million dollars, so there's a long way to go, but it's a good start.

> And, once again, the goal here is to raise this total of $12 million ($1 million + $1 million match in May, and then $5 million + $5 million match in June) as a test for a much larger effort. I've seen too many overly cynical folks say "$12 million isn't enough to change politics." And you're right. But that's not the goal. This is $12 million to be used in specific races as a proof of concept for a much larger moonshot.

The performance is a benefit for Mayday PAC, a group begun by Lessig and GOP media strategist Mark McKinnon in hopes of raising $12 million that could be used to target candidates opposed to inhibiting the political influence of wealthy donors.

> Palmer, who has a wildly devoted following, used the crowd-funding website Kickstarter to raise $1.2 million to finance her last CD and tour. Mayday PAC already has some deep-pocketed patrons, including TED curator Chris Anderson, LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, and Brad Burnham, managing partner of Union Square Ventures, which has funded the likes of Twitter, Kickstarter, and Tumblr.

> “Impossible.” As the Army used to say, “The difficult we do immediately, the impossible takes a little longer.” And while we’re not opposed to impossible campaigns, we believe it critical that this movement to “restore democracy” also try the merely “difficult.” For long before two-thirds of Congress will propose an amendment to the Constitution and three-quarters of the states will ratify it, Congress could radically change the way campaigns are funded, through a simple majority vote.

> This is the hard work that Congress should do. It’s easy to hold hearings on resolutions that everyone knows will fail. It takes leadership to force debate on ideas that no one believes can pass—but must pass. That’s the leadership that Lyndon Johnson demonstrated, both in the Senate in 1957, and as President, when he forced a reluctant South to finally accept equal rights. That’s the leadership that this nation needs again, but that, in the grandstanding of D.C. partisanship, seems truly “impossible.”

> “[T]his, we believe, is the core problem with our democracy today: that we have outsourced the funding of campaigns to the tiniest fraction of the 1 percent,” write Lawrence Lessig and Mark McKinnon in the Daily Beast. “As members of Congress spend between 30 percent and 70 percent of their time raising campaign cash, they focus their efforts on no more than 150,000 Americans – 0.05 percent of the population, about the same number who are named Lester. And for SuperPACs, the numbers are even tinier. In the 2012 election cycle, 132 Americans contributed 60 percent of the SuperPAC money spent in all races. Congress has become dependent upon this tiny slice of the 1 percent, but in no conceivable way does this tiny fraction represent America.”

> There’s too much money in politics, right? Lawrence Lessig has a new plan to solve an old problem. He wants to end money’s outsize influence on the political process, which subverts democracy and drowns out the masses to do the bidding of the well-to-do few.

> Campaign finance reform comes down to arguing about who gets to decide who gets to be umpire of a game which is, at its core, rigged. And it’s rigged in favor of the rich. Electoral politics is mostly cage matches in the gladiator arena they use to distract us. It’s the circus, and entitlements are the bread.

This problem is not new, but what had been a tide is becoming a flood. With each campaign, our elected officials grow more dependent on big donations from special interests and less dependent on us, their constituents.

> We’ve reached a tipping point for reform. The Great Recession that began in 2007 exposed government and private institutions as deeply flawed and unable to protect ordinary people. The Supreme Court, contrary to common sense and the beliefs of most Americans, has declared that corporations are people and that enormous spending by a billionaire on politics is speech legally equivalent to actual speech by an ordinary citizen.

> Lessig and other leaders of this fight acknowledge it is a tough one. But they have reminded me that when millions of Americans across the political spectrum get riled up and demand change, Congress will listen and will act, and in due course, so will the Supreme Court.

> If successful, Mayday PAC would go from inception to a war chest of over $12 million in just 60 days. That money will then fund campaigns in five congressional districts yet to be announced, targeting candidates that oppose campaign finance reform. It is part of a two election cycle plan to hold candidates accountable to voters on the issue of money in politics and win a Congress committed to enacting campaign finance reform by 2016. If successful in the 2014 cycle, the effort would be expanded for the 2016 elections.

> This experimental new effort will show that regular people are deeply motivated to demand changes that loosen the grip of big money on politics and government. People “commit” by pledging a contribution anywhere between $5 and $10,000, and their commitment is collected only if the Mayday PAC reaches its fundraising target by its deadline.

If Mayday PAC reaches that goal, Lessig and McKinnon have lined up the support of a handful of wealthy donors — mostly from Silicon Valley — to kick in an additional $5 million in matching funds.

> If the renewed push is successful, the PAC would have a $12 million war chest for the 2014 cycle. Though that is a modest sum in the world of big-money politics, the PAC would invest in five targeted congressional races. The campaigns have yet to be announced or determined.

> If you happen to care about things like non-rich people having a say in who holds federal office, you should really go make your pledge to Mayday right now. But since I suspect most readers are pretty skeptical at this point, let me take you through the completely hard-boiled, non-utopian case for supporting the project, which roughly amounts to the following: Mayday, or something like it, turns out to be our last best hope for reducing the massively outsized influence of the 1 percent over public policy.

> I arrive at this conclusion by way of some simple armchair-Marxist analysis, which holds that no significant reform can happen unless some very powerful, very rich interest group decides it has a stake in it. Health care reform had the insurance companies; Wall Street reform had deep-pocketed financial institutions, who saw an opportunity to kneecap their less-regulated competitors.

> "The influence of big money over our political process is worse than it's ever been, and it's evident from the complete dysfunction in Washington," said Professor Lawrence Lessig. "Mayday PAC's success will prove that there are enough people willing to invest in sending Congress the message that it is time for fundamental campaign finance reform." Mark McKinnon adds, "We want a government that works for all of us, not simply the wealthy who bankroll campaign contributions and Super PACs."

> This experimental new effort will show that regular people are deeply motivated to demand changes that loosen the grip of big money on politics and government. People "commit" by pledging a contribution anywhere between $5 and $10,000, and their commitment is collected only if the Mayday PAC reaches its fundraising target by its deadline.

> The Mayday PAC, launched on May 1, announced a crowd funding plan to raise $12 million to back supporters of publicly financed elections in 2014. If people help raise $1 million, with contributions of $10,000 or less, in one month, Lessig said wealthy supporters would kick in another $1 million. The group raised its first $1 million by the middle of May.

> The big supporters providing the matching $1 million include LinkedIn CEO Reid Hoffman, venture capitalist and PayPal co-founder and president of Thiel Capital Peter Thiel, TED curator Chris Anderson, Union Square Ventures partners Brad Burnham and Fred Wilson, Women's Entrepreneurial Festival co-founder Joanne Wilson, and Schooner Capital founder Vin Ryan.


###[The Atlantic: A Real Step to Fix Democracy](http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/05/a-real-step-to-fix-democracy/371898/)
> In January, Gallup found that Americans from across the political spectrum picked the failure of “government” as the top problem facing America today. The vast majority link that failure to the influence of money in politics. Yet more than 90 percent of us don’t see how that influence could be reduced. Washington won’t fix itself, so who else could fix it?

> It turns out the framers of our Constitution thought about this problem precisely. Two days before the Constitution was complete, they noticed a bug. In the version they were considering, only Congress could propose amendments to the Constitution. That led Virginia’s George Mason to ask, what if Congress itself was the problem?

> “In 2016, number one, there will be fewer fights that we have to have, because people will get on the right side of this issue just out of fear,” Lessig says. “And number two, we’ll have a whole bunch of people more interested in investing, because they see a potential return here.”

> “[Vouchers] would radically change the business model of fundraising overnight,” Lessig says. “You would not have candidates spending their time talking to the tiniest fraction of the 1%. They’d be thinking about the ways to attract a wide range of contributions from everybody who has a voucher.”

>  Is it possible to create a "super PAC" that would end the power of super PACs by drawing enough Americans into the system to limit the influence of big money in politics? And is it possible to get voters excited about a subject as dry as campaign finance?  Harvard law professor Lawrence Lessig is leading a crusade to answer both those questions with a yes.

>  If the Mayday PAC is able to take out five members of Congress this cycle “who are on the wrong side of this issue,” Lessig said, “then when 2016 comes around, magically a whole bunch of members of Congress would be on the right side of this issue, and we would have a narrower range of people that we would have to be going after, and we would have very good data

> WASHINGTON -- On May 1, Harvard professor Lawrence Lessig launched what he calls
  a "super PAC to end all super PACs."  Lessig, one of a new breed of campaign
  finance reformers, wants to change the corrupted system by which politicians
  now raise money for their campaigns.

> The irony is to get money out of politics, reformers must raise money of their own.
  On that measure, Lessig's new     organization has gotten off to a super start.

> Just when you were fed up with our petty, craven politics and were ready to
  write off the next few years as a circus of filibusters, gridlock and
  investigations, comes an idea so simple yet subversive that it offers a
  glorious ray of hope.

> Call it [Lawrence Lessig's](http://www.lessig.org/) "money bomb."  It’s an
  ingenious plan to make the drive for small-dollar publicly funded elections a
  central issue in 2016. With a little luck, the Harvard law professor’s idea
  could help save the republic.

> Harvard’s Lawrence Lessig, the crusader for campaign finance reform, feels
  that his fellow reformers don’t think big or boldly enough to inspire the kind
  of grassroots campaign that might break elite donors’ stranglehold on
  America’s political system.

> In a recent piece in [*The
  Atlantic*](http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/04/campaign-finance-and-the-nihilist-politics-of-resignation/360437/),
  Lessig argues that public cynicism about the prospect of deep reform actually
  working is the only thing keeping widespread outrage at our slide toward
  plutocracy in check. And he thinks that only a “moonshot” campaign — an
  ambitious, collective, national effort “unlike anything they’ve seen before” —
  can “crack this cynicism” and usher in a more democratic system.



### <a href="http://time.com/84556/lawrence-lessig-superpac/" target="_blank">Time: Campaign Finance Reformer Launches Super PAC to End Super PACs</a>

> Mayday PAC was already 8 percent of the way toward its goal by Thursday
  afternoon with more than $75,000 pledged and nearly 31 days left to reach its
  target.

> To say Mayday PAC faces an uphill fight is an understatement. Proponents of
  serious campaign finance reform face strong opponents in both parties, and the
  Supreme Court and lower courts have issued rulings in recent years striking
  down or throwing into doubt a wide array of restrictions on political
  spending.

> If the idea behind Mayday PAC sounds absurd, that’s by design. Cynicism and
  defeatism about government run so deep through American politics, Lessig
  believes, that the only way to “crack this cynicism” is with an idea so
  exceedingly ambitious—a “moonshoot,” he calls it—that people might be roused
  to get behind it.
