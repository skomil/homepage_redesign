###[Holland Sentinel: Upton, Clements wage TV ad war in 6th District](http://www.hollandsentinel.com/article/20141023/NEWS/141029509/10923/NEWS)
> Both sides, however, are playing out on the airwaves with Clements spending $271,000 on television advertising on top of the $1.2 million SuperPAC MayDay has spent in an attempt to unseat one of the most powerful Republicans in Congress where he is the chairman of the influential Energy and Commerce Committee. Upton, meanwhile, has spent $1 million on TV advertising, according to the Washington Post.

> The campaign has $127,000 cash on hand, a fraction of the $1.6 million Upton has left over after raising nearly $3 million this election. It’s in the details where the starkest differences between the campaigns come to light. About $2.1 million of Upton’s campaign war chest came from Political Action Committees.



###[WMUK: Group Asks for Investigation of Upton](http://wmuk.org/post/group-asks-investigation-upton)
> The American Democracy Legal Fund claims that the Republican Congressman violated federal law and House rules by improperly threatening retribution against contributors to a super Pac. The Mayday super Pac recently announced that it was spending $1.5-million on ads in the district critical of Upton, who is chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee. The Huffington Post reported that a staff member of that committee contacted donors to the fund to express displeasure. 



###[Politico: Buzz: Upton's Office Denies Calls To CEOs Affiliated With Mayday PAC](http://www.politico.com/morningtech/1014/morningtech15801.html)
> House Commerce Chairman Fred Upton’s office flatly denied that the lawmaker or his office had made “angry calls” to Silicon Valley players with ties to the Mayday PAC, which is spending about $1.5 million in Michigan’s 6th District to blast Upton. “I have never called anybody — donors or CEOs affiliated with Mayday PAC,” said Gary Andres, staff director for the House Energy and Commerce Committee, in a statement to POLITICO. “It just didn’t happen.”

> The debate over the allegations was heating up on Wednesday, as Mayday PAC founder Lawrence Lessig called the reported outreach "outrageous." He said: “If news reports are true that he's using paid government staff to intimidate pro-reform donors with business before his committee, that's beyond outrageous — it would be unethical and possibly illegal." The American Democracy Legal Fund also asked the Office of Congressional Ethics to investigate whether Upton violated ethics rules based on the report.



###[TPM: Can Democrats Actually Pull Off Huge Upset Of Top House GOPer?](http://talkingpointsmemo.com/dc/fred-upton-reelectin-race)
> Since Oct. 9, MayDay PAC -- Harvard professor Larry Lessig's super PAC to outlaw super PACs -- has spent $1.2 million on a TV advertising buy and more than $150,000 on direct mailers to attack Upton, according to the group's filings with the Federal Election Commission.

> "If we’re going to reform the way campaigns are funded, we need to stand up to kingpin politicians at the heart of corruption," Lessig wrote in announcing the group's entry into the race. "We need to make an example of them to show that we, the people, want our democracy back."



###[Fortune: In Washington, It's Sean Parker versus Sean Parker](http://fortune.com/2014/10/22/sean-parker-versus-sean-parker/)
> On October 9, Mayday announced it was going after Upton for being the “worst of the worst,” exemplifying “money’s corrupting influence in politics,” and it has since dumped nearly $1.5 million into negative ads in the lawmaker’s southwestern Michigan home base. That’s been enough to put a serious scare into Upton, who won his last election with 55 percent of the vote in a swing district that Obama carried in 2008 and lost, narrowly, to Romney in 2012. Last Friday, Upton told the Kalamazoo Gazette editorial board that he’s tracked down Mayday donors.



###[Bloomberg: With Rounds on Thin Ice, Super-PAC Ups Its Buy in South Dakota](http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2014-10-22/with-rounds-on-thin-ice-superpac-ups-its-buy-in-south-dakota)
> According to Montgomery, in 2010 the retiring Governor Rounds "knew his Cabinet secretary, Richard Benda, was going to work for an investor in the Northern Beef Packers plant about the time he approved Benda's proposal to give the plant more state aid," a total $600,000 in loans. 

> All the fury and Michael Bay-movie explosions around the story are feeding right into the ongoing work of Mayday PAC, the Larry Lessig-founded group that wants to upend the post-Citizens United campaign finance regime and reform politics. It just upped its commitment to South Dakota to $1.4 million.



###[New Observer: Upton, Clements swap charges on PAC's ad campaign](http://www.newsobserver.com/2014/10/21/4253219_upton-clements-swap-charges-on.html?rh=1)
> Mayday founder Lawrence Lessig told The Associated Press that the PAC seeks to change campaign financing laws so donors can't buy political influence. He said Upton wasn't living up to his claims to be a backer of changing the role of private money in politics.

> "We'd love to see Fred Upton support that kind of reform," Lessig said.



###[National Journal: Is Michigan's Most Powerful Republican Really in Political Danger?](http://www.nationaljournal.com/politics/is-michigan-s-most-powerful-republican-really-in-political-danger-20141021)
> Clements's prowess has garnered interest both inside the district and out, but anyone who wasn't paying attention before certainly raised their eyebrows this month when an outside super PAC announced plans to pump nearly $2 million into efforts to oust Upton. The group, Mayday PAC, aims to target politicians beholden to moneyed interests. On Oct. 9, it named Upton among its handful of targets for the 2014 cycle.

> While Upton maintains the super PAC attacks haven't changed his strategy—or made him any more vulnerable—his opponents see a candidate on the defensive. Mayday's first ad targeted the incumbent on Medicare drug prices and failing to protect patients with preexisting conditions. Days later, an Upton ad lamented the "lies" opponents were spreading and touting his efforts to help seniors on Medicare and patients with preexisting conditions. It's an unusual tack for a Republican who has been one of the most outspoken opponents of Obamacare.




###[Argus Leader: Mayday PAC launches anti-Rounds ad](http://www.argusleader.com/story/davidmontgomery/2014/10/21/mayday-anti-rounds-ad/17697167/)
> The spot, airing tomorrow, features "South Dakota voters" criticizing Republican Mike Rounds over his handling of the EB-5 scandal.

> Mayday's ad is the first appearance in the South Dakota Senate campaign of a "negative testimonial" spot, in which ordinary voters rather than a narrator or candidate criticize an opponent.



###[Business Insider: Some Democrats Think the 'Warren Wing' Of The Party Can Save Them From An Election Day Disaster](http://www.businessinsider.com/can-the-elizabeth-warren-save-democrats-from-election-day-disaster-2014-10#ixzz3Gsb3Qb9r)
> The two groups are separate entities. PCCC is focused on promoting a progressive political agenda, while MayDay, which was founded by Harvard Law School professor and activist Lawrence Lessig, is dedicated to campaign finance reform. However, MayDay recruited the PCCC's independent expenditure team to manage several of its efforts this cycle and, in those races, the PAC's efforts are clearly aiding the "Warren wing" strategy. 



###[CJ Online: Robert's camp questions credentials of woman appearing in anti-Roberts ad](http://m.cjonline.com/news/2014-10-21/roberts-camp-questions-credentials-woman-appearing-anti-roberts-ad#gsc.tab=0)
> In a statement, Mayday PAC co-founder Mark McKinnon said Moffitt supports Orman because he is a reformer.

> “Pat Roberts is so desperate to distract people from the truth about his record of supporting Wall Street and the special interests that he’s using a false blog post to attack a 76-year-old woman for speaking her mind,” McKinnon said.



###[TPM: Orman Gets A Big Investment From The Super PAC Opposed To Super PACs](http://omnifeed.com/article/talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/greg-orman-mayday-pac-kansas-senate-race)
> The PAC reported the spending on TV advertising over the weekend to the Federal Election Commission and released a new ad. The buy is the campaign- finance-reform-focused group's first spending in support of Orman, who has said that he would support a constitutional amendment overturning the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision.



###[Bloomberg: Super-PAC Ducks Fight With Darth Vader](http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2014-10-20/super-pac-ducks-fight-with-darth-vader)
> Mayday has backed eight candidates -- but not Grimes, even though she is running against the chief antagonist of campaign finance reformers, the man they call Darth Vader. McConnell vehemently opposes public financing of elections, tighter limits on contributions and spending and more public disclosure. 

> Another super-PAC that supports campaign finance reform, Every Voice Action, is spending $1 million to defeat McConnell. But Mayday, which has raised more than $10 million, has sat out the race, even as it squandered almost $2 million supporting Jim Rubens’ long-shot challenge to Scott Brown in New Hampshire's Republican Senate primary.



###[Sioux City Journal: Outside spending in South Dakota U.S. Senate race nears $2M](http://siouxcityjournal.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/outside-spending-in-south-dakota-u-s-senate-race-nears/article_552baf2f-9e28-57a6-8c3d-f34a6e75825d.html)
> By 4 p.m. Thursday, outside groups had reported spending $462,529.13 so far this election cycle in support of Weiland and $152,285.77 against him, a net result of $310,243.36 in his favor.

> Mayday PAC, a so-called Super PAC (political action committee) that wants to end Super PACs, spent $462,529.13 in support of Weiland.



###[MLIVE: Congressman Fred Upton discusses Mayday PAC, climate change in Kalamazoo Gazette Editorial Board interview](http://www.mlive.com/news/kalamazoo/index.ssf/2014/10/mayday_pac_ad_funders_against.html)
> Upton said in an interview with the Kalamazoo Gazette Editorial Board he has talked to some funders of the PAC who contributed six figures to it under the illusion that the PAC would work on eliminating dysfunction in politics.

> The national crowd-funded super PAC launched a $1.5 million ad campaign against Upton accusing him of taking $2.5 million from drug and insurance interests during his time in office. A 30-second ad launched on local and cable television stations this month.



###[The Wall Street Journal: In Fred Upton's District, Big Money Makes an Appearance](http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2014/10/20/in-fred-uptons-district-big-money-makes-an-appearance/)
>  Mr. Upton is generally considered a safe incumbent. But this year he is nonetheless at the center of a new storm. More opposition money is being dumped in his district, which leans Republican, than ever before in his political career, mostly by the SuperPac  Mayday.US.



###[Huffington Post: Silicon Valley CEOs Get A Warm Washington Welcome To Politics](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/10/20/mayday-pac-upton_n_6016028.html)
> Silicon Valley executives who gave big money to a super PAC have received angry calls from a top aide to one of its targets, as well as calls from the targeted congressman himself, sources familiar with the situation told The Huffington Post.

> According to people familiar with the situation, committee staff director and former super lobbyist Gary Andres personally has been calling the CEOs of major Silicon Valley tech companies, hammering them for coming after Upton and spooking Mayday's donors, who worry their companies will get rougher treatment when and if Upton survives.



###[KOTA News: Million here, million there - soon it's real political money](http://www.kotatv.com/news/south-dakota-news/million-here-million-there-soon-its-real-political-money/29158032)
> A lot of big bucks are being tossed around the South Dakota U.S. Senate campaign this month. Now, a super PAC plunks down another quarter of a million dollars in an effort to push Democrat Rick Weiland into the lead less than three weeks from the general election.

> This comes nine days after MAYDAY.US announced a $1 million campaign to blunt Republican Mike Rounds’ chances of taking over Senator Tim Johnson’s seat Nov. 4.


###[Michigan Radio: DCCC pulls plug on four Democrats, but there may still be an upset in Kalamazoo](http://michiganradio.org/post/dccc-pulls-plug-four-democrats-there-may-still-be-upset-kalamazoo)
> More than a year ago, a man told me I should get to know Paul Clements, who he said was going to beat Congressman Fred Upton in the Sixth Congressional District, which is based in Kalamazoo. I was polite, but didn’t take him seriously.

> And last week, a stunning thing happened. Mayday, a crowd-funded political action committee announced it was going to throw a million and half dollars into this race to try to defeat Upton. Suddenly, this may have turned into a contest.


###[The Hill: Opinion - Markos Moulitsas: So goes South Dakota](http://thehill.com/opinion/markos-moulitsas/220746-markos-moulitsas-so-goes-south-dakota)
> It’s no surprise that former South Dakota Gov. Mike Rounds, who won his two gubernatorial contests by massive margins in 2002 and 2006, is flummoxed, as he watches his once-certain bid in his state’s open Senate contest suddenly endangered. Today, Rounds faces a three-way dogfight for a seat Republicans had long ago notched in the “gain” column. 

> Senate Democrats announced last week they were engaging in the race, reserving $1 million of TV ad time in this dirt-cheap media state. Larry Lessig’s Mayday PAC committed another million. Republicans shrugged off the sudden outside interest, telling the Washington Examiner that their internals continued to give Rounds an 11- to 14-point lead. Then, they proved how not worried they were by announcing a $750,000 ad buy on Monday. 


###[Indian County: National Eyes on South Dakota](http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/10/13/national-eyes-south-dakota-157326)
> One of the ideas Lessig has brought to fruition is Mayday PAC, a crowdsourced SuperPAC dedicated to wiping SuperPACs off the political map by funding candidates pledged to changing the system. Rick Weiland, the Democrat in the South Dakota race, has promised that his first bill will be a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United, the Supreme Court case that made corporate people equal to human people in funding elections.

> Because campaign finance reform has become a major issue, and because the outcome may determine which party controls the senate, national eyes are on the South Dakota senate race.


###[MSNBC: Sleepy South Dakota Senate race gets jolt of money and attention](http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/sleepy-south-dakota-senate-race-gets-jolt-money-and-attention)
> This week, Weiland has also received a $1 million pledge of support from Mayday PAC, an outside SuperPAC devoted to curbing the role of big money in politics. 

> The infusion of money into such a sparsely populated state could make a real difference, says Patrick Ruffini, a GOP strategist and co-founder of Echelon Insights. In terms of ad buys, “the relative volume is pretty low, which means there’s an opportunity for an outside spender to make an outsized dent in this race,” Ruffini wrote in an email. 


###[MLIVE: National super PAC launches $1.5 million ad campaign against Congressman Fred Upton](http://www.mlive.com/news/kalamazoo/index.ssf/2014/10/national_super_pac_launches_15.html)
> "Fred Upton is the worst of the worst when it comes to crony capitalism and this is a great place to show that voters care about the influence of big money in politics," said Mark McKinnon, former media strategist for George W. Bush and co-founder of the Mayday PAC. "Using the power of crowd-funding, we're going to give Fred Upton the fight of his political life and send a message to other crooked politicians that no matter how powerful you are or how entrenched you have become, we're coming after you and we're going to take our democracy back."



###[MLIVE: Democrat Paul Clements talks PAC money, Obamacare and Congressman Fred Upton's record in Kalamazoo Gazette Editorial Board interview](http://www.mlive.com/news/kalamazoo/index.ssf/2014/10/democrat_paul_clements_talks_c.html)
> "(The Mayday PAC's) purpose is to remove the influence of big money in politics," Clements said. "The reason they picked Congressman Upton is because they think he is one of the most – I'll use their terms – corrupt in Washington in terms of being influenced by big money. They get their money from 60,000 people around the country, and they ... think our democracy is going to work better when it's representing the people just when our votes, when you and I can make a big difference. The more influence big money has, the harder it is for you and I, the voter, and the citizens to influence politics."



###[New Republic: The Senate May Be at Stake in South Dakota](http://www.newrepublic.com/article/119761/south-dakota-could-decide-senate-majority-mike-rounds-rick-weiland)
> “2016 is a contingent function,” says Lessig. “If we’re successful in 2014 … If we’re able to show up with a convincing brief about the effectiveness about this type of intervention, then it’s easier” to raise the hundreds of millions that will be necessary two years from now. For that matter, regardless of what a South Dakota win would mean for Mayday in 2016, it would send a terrifying message to incumbents and establishment candidates in parts of the country no one previously believed were competitive. Politicians would not only have to worry about crossing their powerful donors; they’d suddenly have to worry about crossing the reformers, too.



###[TPM: Can Dems Pull Another Crazy Senate Coup In South Dakota?](http://talkingpointsmemo.com/dc/rick-weiland-mayday-pac-south-dakota-senate)
> Some recent polling prompted MayDay PAC to get into the South Dakota campaign, its founder, Harvard University professor Lawrence Lessig, told TPM in an email. A Survey USA poll released on Tuesday found Rounds, a former governor who has been dogged by a scandal about alleged corruption involving immigration visas issued during his administration, at 35 percent, Pressler at 32 percent, and Weiland at 28 percent.


###[Salon: The Midterm Report: A South Dakota Senate upset?](http://www.salon.com/2014/10/08/the_midterm_report_a_south_dakota_upset/)
> In a new post on the South Dakota race, Nate Silver gives Pressler a slightly better chance at winning than Weiland, noting that Weiland’s support hasn’t cracked 30 percent in three-way polls of the race. (Silver still considers Rounds the favorite.) But Weiland could get a boost from a planned $1 million blitz in support of his campaign from Mayday PAC, the “super PAC to end all super PACs” that’s backing Weiland on account of his support for campaign finance reform.


###[Kelo: South Dakota Senate Race Gains Interest of Democrats Nationwide](http://kelo.com/news/articles/2014/oct/09/south-dakota-senate-race-gains-interest-of-democrats-nationwide/)
> The Mayday PAC stuck $2 million into the race earlier this week, and Wednesday afternoon the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee announced a $1 million pledge to help Weiland. Both groups will use most of the money on TV advertising. 

> South Dakota Democratic leader Bernie Hunhoff calls it a missing piece of the Weiland campaign puzzle, saying the Sioux Falls businessman has had a near perfect game plan up to this point, but the one thing he has been missing is the money.


###[Electablog: BREAKING: Crowd-funded SuperPAC to spend $1.5 million to help Paul Clements unseat Fred Upton](http://www.eclectablog.com/2014/10/breaking-crowd-funded-superpac-to-spend-1-5-million-on-paul-clements-to-unseat-fred-upton.html#disqus_thread)
> This election cycle, MaydayPAC is testing their belief that they can have an impact on electing people into office who will help bring about significant change in election funding by working with just five campaigns, carefully selected to meet a set of criteria outlined HERE. One of those criteria is that the victory would be both surprising, and understood to be tied to this reform.

> Toward that effort, MaydayPAC has chosen to spend $1.5 million to help Democrat Paul Clements get elected in Michigan’s 6th Congressional District. The seat is currently held by the ultra-conservative corporatist Fred Upton, the powerful chair of the House Energy & Commerce Committee and a shill for Big Oil.


###[The Wall Street Journal: Crowd Funding Lifts Democrat Weiland in South Dakota](http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2014/10/07/crowd-funding-lifts-democrat-weiland-in-south-dakota/)
> MAYDAY.US, co-founded by Harvard University law professor Lawrence Lessig and Republican strategist Mark McKinnon, said it is spending $1 million on behalf of Democratic candidate Rick Weiland. The money would dwarf the amount either Mr. Weiland or his main rival had in hand as of the middle of the year. By June 30, Mr. Weiland had $447,919 in cash on hand, compared with $754,800 for Republican contender Mike Rounds, the former South Dakota governor.



###[Washington Post: The 'super PAC to end all super PAC's' to spend $1M for Rick Weiland in South Dakota](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2014/10/07/the-super-pac-to-end-all-super-pacs-to-spend-1m-for-rick-weiland-in-south-dakota/)
> Mayday PAC, a group that is trying to curb the influence of money in politics, is launching a $1 million effort to support underdog Democrat Rick Weiland in the South Dakota Senate race with four weeks to go until the midterm elections, the group announced Tuesday morning.

> Mayday PAC is kicking off its effort with a new ad touting Weiland as crusader against "big money."



###[Vox: Why campaign finance reformers are pouring millions into South Dakota's Senate race](http://www.vox.com/2014/10/8/6936913/lawrence-lessig-south-dakota-senate-rick-weiland)
> This week, academic and campaign finance reform activist Larry Lessig announced plans to spend $1 million on a Senate race in South Dakota, to boost the campaign of Democrat Rick Weiland. The investment will likely be met with some skepticism, coming so soon after a failed attempt by Lessig to help a little-known New Hampshire Senate candidate defeat Scott Brown in the GOP primary. And most Democrats have long written off this open seat — the forecasters view Weiland as an overwhelming underdog, and he hasn't led in a single poll:

> But in an interview, Lessig argued to me that Weiland could win, and that his victory would help prove that voters care about reforming corruption in politics. "Our objective is to demonstrate something that people in Washington don't believe, which is that voters will vote on the basis of this issue," Lessig says. "To do that, you have to pick races that are difficult, where nobody expects you to win, but where based on our research we think we can win." Here's why he and other campaign finance reformers think South Dakota is one of those races.



###[Bloomberg: The "Super PAC to End Super PACs" Jumps into South Dakota's Senate Race](http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2014-10-07/the-super-pac-to-end-super-pacs-jumps-into-south-dakotas-senate-race)
> Mayday.us, the crowd-funded Super PAC launched by Larry Lessig to back "anti-corruption," and pro-campaign finance reform candidates is beginning a $1 million ad buy in South Dakota's heretofore sleepy Senate race. It's on behalf of Rick Weiland, the Democratic candidate and two-time loser of statewide races who, up until now, has been considered an afterthought. 

> So, why would Mayday walk onto the field? The PAC points to a new Public Policy Polling survey that shows Republican Mike Rounds, a former governor who easily won two terms, slipping to 35 percent support against Weiland's 28 percent. Weiland's favorables have surpassed those of Rounds; in a four-way race with former Senator Larry Pressler and conservative Gordon Howie, PPP suggested that Weiland had the most potential to surge.



###[Argus Leader: PAC to spend $1 million for Rick Weiland, a big-money foe](http://www.argusleader.com/story/news/politics/2014/10/07/argus-leader-exclusive-pac-spend-million-big-money-foe/16845397/)
> Rick Weiland's number one issue as a U.S. Senate candidate is assailing the role of "big money" in politics. He promises his first act in office would be introducing a constitutional amendment to reinstate campaign-finance regulations overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court.

> "Like the rest of us, South Dakotans are tired of seeing Congress crippled by its dependence on campaign cash and the cronies who supply it," said Mayday PAC co-founder Mark McKinnon in a news release. "The only way to take our democracy back is to elect reformers like Rick Weiland."



###[Huff Post: Unlikely South Dakota Senate Race Attracts Big Money From Campaign Finance Reformers](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/10/07/south-dakota-senate_n_5943274.html)
> Mayday PAC, founded by Harvard professor Lawrence Lessig, made the investment as Weiland has failed to take advantage of troubles for the frontrunner in the Senate race, former Gov. Mike Rounds (R). Rounds' poll numbers have dropped as he faces questions about a contract his administration gave to administer a foreign visa program.

> The $1 million expenditure is part of planned $2 million campaign by a coalition of groups that includes Mayday, Communications Workers of America, Every Voice Action, Democracy for America and Progressive Campaign Change Committee. The multi-million dollar advertising contribution may have a big impact on a race that has been largely ignored by the two major political parties and major donors.



###[Argus Leader: New Super PAC backing Weiland tomorrow](http://www.argusleader.com/story/davidmontgomery/2014/10/06/mayday-pac-weiland/16826369/)
> A new well-funded "Super PAC" is buying ads to back Democrat Rick Weiland's campaign.

> Local television documents show Mayday PAC will likely run ads across the state starting Tuesday Oct. 6. A purchase form from statewide cable provider Midcontinent Communications shows around $12,000 in ads over the next week. Broadcast stations KELO-TV, KSFY-TV, KDLT-TV and KCLO-TV also have forms online indicating Mayday PAC is purchasing ad time.

> The tech-funded Mayday PAC announced plans Tuesday to spend $1 million to help Rick Weiland, a pro-campaign finance reform Democrat facing an uphill battle to win the Senate seat in South Dakota.

> The Weiland race pitting a “reformer against a corrupt politician in South Dakota could determine control of the Senate this year,” said Mark McKinnon, a former media strategist for President George W. Bush and co-founder of Mayday with Harvard Law professor Larry Lessig.



###[Ozy: Larry Lessig: How to Fix Democracy](http://www.ozy.com/pov/larry-lessig-how-to-fix-democracy/34328)
> The candidates that Americans get to choose from of course have been selected by voters in primaries. But to be able to run in a primary, or in a general election, those candidates must secure an extraordinary amount of campaign cash. The providers of that cash aren’t all of us. And they are certainly not even a representative sample of us. They are instead a tiny, tiny fraction of the 1 percent (arguably the same proportion of America as 1,200 is of Hong Kong), which, as a massive empirical study by Princeton’s Martin Gilens and Ben Page suggests, produces a government that is responsive to the “economic elite and organized business interests,” but not at all to “the preferences of the average American.” We have, like Hong Kong would have, a biased filter at the first stage of our democracy. And that bias produces a government that is not responsive to us.



###[The New Yorker: Embrace the Irony](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/10/13/embrace-irony)
> As all of us look back at that history, we wonder: How could they have thought like this?” He asked, “Are there things that will make our kids look back on us and say, ‘Seriously?’ . . . How could we believe that the thickness of one’s wallet is the metric of citizenship?” He sketched a dire portrait of American politics. More than ninety-nine per cent of Americans are excluded from the access that large campaign donations afford, he said. And yet people have accepted this state of affairs. He cited a poll in which ninety-six per cent of Americans said they believe that it’s important to reduce the influence of money in politics but only nine per cent believe that it is likely to happen. The Mayday PAC, Lessig said, was intended to elect a Congress that would pass reform and demonstrate to Americans that change was possible. “This is the moral question of our age,” he said. “Can we reclaim our democracy?”



###[Politico: A Crowd-Funded Experiment In Saving Democracy](http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/10/a-crowd-funded-experiment-in-saving-democracy-111484.html#ixzz3EzmgW33e)
> Politicians spend somewhere between 30 percent and 70 percent of their time raising money for campaigns, according to “Republic, Lost” by Lawrence Lessig. This doesn’t leave enough time for thinking deeply about the real problems our nation faces: fighting terrorism, creating jobs, educating our children and much more. We won’t make enough progress on major issues until we change the way campaigns are funded. We need to take our democracy back.



###[Huff Post: We Should Be Protesting, Too](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/lawrence-lessig/we-should-be-protesting-too_b_5917486.html)
> The pattern has been common in America's democracy too. Across the Old South, the Democratic Primary was limited to "whites only." That bias produced a democracy responsive to whites -- only. The battle for equal rights was a fight to remove that illegitimate bias, and give African Americans an equal say in their government.

> Today there's no "white primary." Today, there's a "green primary." To run in any election, primary or general, candidates must raise extraordinary sums, privately. Yet they raise that money not from all of us. They raise it from a tiny, tiny few. In the last non-presidential election, only about .05 percent of America gave the maximum contribution to even one congressional candidate in either the primary or general election; .01 percent gave $10,000 or more; and in 2012, 132 Americans gave 60 percent of the superPAC money spent. This is the biased filter in the first stage of our American democracy.



###[Time: Larry Lessig Compares America's Democracy to Hong Kong's](http://time.com/3436637/larry-lessig-democracy/)
> American democracy is controlled by a tiny minority of moneyed funders, Lessig believes, much as New York politics were controlled by political bosses during the 19th century. He likened Super PACs’ impact on Congress to that of Boss Tweed, the nineteenth-century New York senator who said he doesn’t “care who does the electing as long as I get to do the nominating.”

> Two TV stars — “Star Trek’s” George Takei and “Seinfeld’s” Jason Alexander — are joining forces with a crowd-funded super-PAC that aims to “end all super-PACs.”

> The pair is among the celeb judges of a video ad contest being held by the Mayday PAC. The contest calls on participants to create 30-second ads about campaign finance reform that could air on national TV.



###[Grist: How should funders and foundations deal with polarization?](http://grist.org/climate-energy/how-should-funders-and-foundations-deal-with-polarization/)
> The second option for institutional philanthropy is to fund efforts to de-polarize the system through procedural reforms — “open primaries, nonpartisan redistricting, changes to Senate filibuster rules, campaign finance reform,” and the like. This kind of thing has always had a strong pull among the intelligentsia; every generation produces another wave of good-government types, “goo-goos” in the lingo, trying to fix the system. You can see Lawrence Lessig gaining some traction going after money in politics.

> Your mission, should you choose to accept it: Make a 30-second ad to wake up America to the crisis of big money in our politics.

> Inspired by MoveOn’s “Bush in 30 seconds” video ad contest from a decade ago, we’re asking citizens to create 30-second video ads that could be aired on national TV.

###[Bill Moyers: Record for Midterm Dark Money Already Broken - and a New Anti-Super PAC](http://billmoyers.com/2014/09/23/record-midterm-dark-money-already-broken-new-anti-super-pac/)
> In 2009 and 2010, the Supreme Court used a series of cases — Emily’s List v. FEC, Speech Now v. FEC and Citizens United v. FEC — to effectively gut most limits on “independent expenditures” in elections. And a flood of dark money followed. As Harvard law scholar Lawrence Lessig told BillMoyers.com back in April, “if money always finds its way in, we wouldn’t have seen that. The rules changed and the amount of money and the size of the influence of large contributors went up dramatically.”



###[Times-Call: Brian Litwin: Stop the D.C. - private sector revolving door](http://www.timescall.com/columnists/opinion-local/ci_26574405/brian-litwin-stop-d-c-private-sector-revolving)
> But not all is lost. New York's most recent gubernatorial race saw Zephyr Teachout win more than half of all counties in New York, strictly running on a platform of removing money from politics (though Andrew Cuomo still won). Lawrence Lessig runs the May-Day Super Pac, which is designed as the Super Pac to end all Super Pacs by financially supporting candidates who want to remove money from politics. The best news of all is that this is a bipartisan issue. According to a recent poll by the Global Strategy Group, 90 percent of Americans believe it is important to reduce the influence of money in politics.



###[Washington Post: Inside the bizarro super PAC that hates super PACs](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2014/09/17/inside-the-bizarro-super-pac-that-hates-super-pacs/)
> This is the thing about Mayday, as Harvard law Prof. Lawrence Lessig, one of the co-founders of the group, explained to the Post by phone: 2014 is, for them, the equivalent of poking an anthill with a stick to see what happens. Granted, they've got better analytical tools than sticks, and they're being more thoughtful about what gets poked, but the analogy is generally accurate. By investing in a variety of races in 2014, Mayday hopes to learn if voters are sufficiently receptive to a campaign finance reform message to justify a bigger and better-funded push in 2016.

> "The interventions that we're picking, we're kind of picking to fill out the various corners of the data matrix," Lessig told us, calling the New Hampshire results "pretty interesting and confirming." You see a 27 point loss. Lessig sees more numbers in the matrix. Ants running in a particular direction.



###[Tech President: First POST: The Lessig of Two Evils](http://techpresident.com/news/25271/first-post-lessig-two-evils)
> On the plus side, Lessig argues that the money MayDay spent in New Hampshire backing longshot Jim Rubens against frontrunner Scott Brown (which Slate reported at a whopping $1.6 million and Re/Code put at a still substantial $600K) had an impact in raising attention to the issue of money in politics. He writes that 37% of primary voters surveyed said "reducing the corrupting influence of politics [sic] was a major or deciding factor in their vote for Senate." (I think Lessig means reducing the influence of private money in politics, but does no one proofread his emails for him?) That said, a large chunk of that group apparently gave their votes to Brown (or, as Lessig put it "among that 37%, our candidate beat the Republican nominee by 18 points!") which shows just how hard it is to impact voters' opinions in a meaningful way.

> This is just the beginning of Mayday’s involvement in New Hampshire. Lessig and the PAC are targeting the first-in-the-nation primary state to be the catalyst of campaign finance reform for the entire nation.

> “It’s such conventional wisdom the world doesn’t care about this issue. We want to make it so it’s not,” said Lessig, a Harvard Law professor and activist. “We think it’s essential New Hampshire lead.”

Other prominent Mayday supporters include PayPal cofounder Peter Thiel, LinkedIn cofounder Reid Hoffman, and Union Square Ventures' cofounder Fred Wilson.

> "Silicon Valley is an incredible resource for this movement because it's got both the means and the motive," Lawrence Lessig, MaydayPAC cofounder and Harvard law professor, told National Journal.



###[Huffpost: Sulu Hears Mayday, Tweets Call to Battlestations, Saves World](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/frank-degiacomo/sulu-hears-maydaytweets-c_b_5743312.html)
> Our story begins with a super PAC gone rogue. A super political action committee to literally end all super PACs. Mayday super PAC, started by Harvard Law professor Lawrence Lessig, has the goal of electing candidates to push for public funding of elections in order to end the corrupting influence of big money in American politics.

> Their goal was to raise $5 mil by July 4. If they didn't do that they were going to return all the money they raised back to the donors. By 10 a.m. on July 4 they were still more than a million dollars away! Then out of no where they got a notification that George Takei (aka Sulu) was going to tweet about the Mayday PAC. Lessig believes that Tweet was worth about $750,000.



###[Time: Legal Threats Continue to Fly in New Hampshire Senate Race](http://time.com/3330684/scott-brown-american-democracy-legal-fund/)
> It started Sunday, when New Hampshire Senate candidate Scott Brown threatened to sue Harvard Professor Lawrence Lessig after a outside group he runs called him a “lobbyist” in a campaign mailer, despite the fact that Brown has never registered as a lobbyist. “If you fail to immediately cease the mailer in question, we are leaving all our legal options on the table,” wrote Colin Reed, the campaign manager of New Hampshire for Scott Brown.

> Lessig has defended his mailer by saying that the legal definition of “lobbyist” under Senate rules was not the one he referenced in the mailer. “According to the Senate, Scott Brown isn’t a ‘lobbyist,'” Lessig wrote in a blog post after receiving the legal threat from Brown’s campaign. “But I submit to anyone else in the world, a former Senator joining a ‘law and lobbying firm’ to help with Wall St’s ‘business and governmental affairs’ is to make him a lobbyist.”

> Earlier this year, Lessig announced the creation of MayDay, a super PAC that would take advantage of newly loosened campaign finance laws to spend lots of money supporting candidates who commit to tightening those same campaign finance laws. The big bet was New Hampshire, where MayDay spent $1.6 million supporting long-shot candidate Jim Rubens in the state’s Republican Senate primary. 

> The result: Rubens was pummeled by his opponent Brown, losing by 27 percentage points. “We lost. Badly.” Lessig wrote in an apologetic note on his Tumblr feed. “There’s no spinning this.”

> Early on, Rubens was basically a complete nobody. While he'd been in NH politics in the past, he hadn't actually occupied a political office since the 1990s. He was basically roadkill for the political machine of Scott Brown. However Larry Lessig's Mayday PAC noted that Rubens was the only Republican candidate running on an anti-corruption platform to limit the influence of money in politics. Mayday PAC spent heavily on campaign ads for Rubens, and he ended up getting around 24% of the vote, with Brown pulling in less than 50%. 



###[The Nation: How Zephyr Teachout Taught Democrats a Lesson in Democracy](http://www.thenation.com/article/181565/how-zephyr-teachout-taught-democrats-lesson-democracy#)
> No, Teachout didn’t beat the incumbent governor with the $35 million war chest, but she took nearly 35 percent of the vote Tuesday night, enough to leave a sizable gash in his left flank and do some permanent damage to his hopes of running for national office one day.

> As Harvard law professor, activist and Teachout supporter Larry Lessig pointed out, over the course of the campaign Cuomo recalled no one so much as Richard Nixon: hunkered down, refusing to debate, dodging public appearances, an ethics scandal hovering over his office.



###[Washington Free Beacon: Campaign Finance Reformers Admit Crushing Defeat in New Hampshire](http://freebeacon.com/politics/campaign-finance-reformers-admit-crushing-defeat-in-new-hampshire/)

> “Our first poll found our candidate with 9 percent of the vote,” Lessig explained. “I knew we had to take on some unwinnable races—and win them. But by failing now, we have made the others harder. I should have accepted the advice not to take on that risk.”

A growing number of activists are working to make that happen. The pro-reform Mayday PAC, founded by former Bush media adviser Mark McKinnon and Harvard Law Professor Lawrence Lessig, is targeting five to eight races this election. And after gleaning the data from those races, they “plan to scale up and go big in 2016,” says McKinnon. Asked what he thinks of the constitutional amendment, he replied via email, “I think we have to battle this issue on every single front every single day.”

> “I would not have a chance without the super PAC,” Rubens acknowledged. “Now I do.”

> There is a super PAC called Mayday PAC, which has the paradoxical goal of rooting out big money from our political system. To that end, the PAC has endorsed the long-shot candidacy of Jim Rubens, Brown's opponent who has pledged to back campaign finance reform. Rubens is touted on Mayday mail pieces as a "small business owner and entrepreneur." Brown is described as "Former Washington lobbyist and Massachusetts senator."

> That's the ill-advised fight Brown decided to pick. His campaign manager, Colin Reed, sent a letter to Mayday PAC's Lawrence Lessig, a professor at Harvard. "Scott Brown is not nor has he ever been a lobbyist. Ever," Reed writes. "We call on you to immediately cease and desist with the mailer in question, and to use one of your various media appearances as a purported authority on ethics to retract your falsehood."

> Yes, according to the Senate, Scott Brown isn’t a “lobbyist.” But I submit to anyone else in the world, a former Senator joining a “law and lobbying firm” to help with Wall St’s “business and governmental affairs” is to make him a lobbyist. Because to anyone else in the world, when you sell your influence to affect “business and governmental affairs,” you are a lobbyist. 
By contrast, Jim Rubens has promised not to be a “lobbyist” after he leaves government (if indeed he is elected). I take it, by that, Mr. Rubens means he would not accept a position like Scott Brown did either. 


###[Time: Scott Brown Threatens Lawsuit Over Being Called a 'Washington Lobbyist'](http://time.com/3304291/scott-brown-lawsuit-threat-lobbyist/)
> At issue is the federal government’s definition of the word “lobbyist” versus the popular one, i.e. “one who influences government official’s decisions.” The federal government considers only individuals who lobby 20 percent or more of his or her professional time serving a client as a “lobbyist.” In 2013, Nixon Peabody law firm hired Brown to advise in business and governmental affairs matters, focusing on the financial services and commercial real estate industries.

> Lessig responded to the letter quoting the words of Clint Eastwood’s character “Dirty Harry” Callahan — “Go ahead; Make my day” — and offered to openly debate whether Brown was a “lobbyist.” Lessig also asked Brown if it was better to call Brown a former Massachusetts senator “who sold his influence to a DC lobbying firm.”

>Larry Lessig's new SuperPAC must be making a few people in Washington nervous. That's the only thing that could explain former Sen. Scott Brown's office sending a little hate mail demanding an apology for calling the former politician a "lobbyist."

> As Lessig points out, Brown not being a lobbyist largely depends on what a normal person would think a lobbyist is. He quotes The Hill, which details Brown's post-Senate employment.

> "Brown has joined Nixon Peabody, a law and lobby firm, as counsel in the firm’s Boston office. The Massachusetts Republican, also a former state senator, will concentrate his practice on “business and governmental affairs as they relate to the financial services industry as well as on commercial real estate matters,” according to the firm.

> What do a Harvard professor who wants to get big money out of politics and a New Hampshire super PAC that backs some of the state’s most conservative candidates have in common?

> They really don’t like Scott Brown, and they’ve formed a partnership aimed at defeating him in today’s primary election. Instead, they’re both backing Jim Rubens, albeit for very different reasons.

> “We literally are only collaborating on this particular area of overlapping interest, which is Scott Brown and Jim Rubens,” Stark360 Chairman Aaron Day said. “While we may not agree with where (MayDay) is on campaign finance, we agree that cronyism and corruption is a problem that, frankly, people of all political views are deeply concerned about.”

> But one of his GOP opponents, former state Sen. Jim Rubens, received a last-minute boost from the MAYDAY super PAC—the super PAC whose goal is to lessen the influence of super PACs. And Brown’s opponents, including Shaheen, have attacked him relentlessly as an outsider who is too close to Wall Street interests.

> Over the weekend, Brown threatened to sue the super PAC over a mailer that claimed he was a lobbyist. In a letter to Harvard professor Larry Lessig, the founder of the group, Brown’s campaign manager said that Brown had never been a lobbyist. In 2013, he worked as a business and governmental affairs advisor at the Nixon Peabody law firm, but did not register as a lobbyist.

> Scott Brown may be dominating the headlines and the airwaves in the GOP’s quest to unseat Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen. But Jim Rubens is the candidate who offers New Hampshire Republicans the clearest view of where he stands and where the party should be going.

> The Rubens campaign is also being supported by the bipartisan Mayday PAC, which aims to help elect candidates who are likely to push for campaign finance reform. The rising influence of money in politics has an ever-tightening grip on both parties, and it’s a hopeful sign to have a candidate who is serious about meaningful reform.

> Mayday’s focus on New Hampshire and Iowa — both states that hold early, influential presidential primaries — is a deliberate attempt to get campaign finance reform on the radar screens of local activists

> On Saturday, when asked about what New Hampshire can do in the upcoming elections in September and November, Lessig said the public can ask “tough questions” and support candidates who are for reforming the system. If these candidates sweep the elections, Lessig said, that will carry over to the 2016 presidential election. New Hampshire has the first presidential primary in the nation.

> Even though Mayday PAC has not yet started advertising on behalf of Shea-Porter, she unquestionably measures up to Lessig’s criteria.

> There are 144,000 people in the United States named Lester — or .05 percent. That’s also the percentage of affluent Americans who gave the maximum amount allowed to a federal candidate — hence Lesterland equals the American federal election system.

> It’s a conceit used by Harvard Law School professor Lawrence Lessig in a book, in well-received TED Talks and, this week, in the keynote address at the annual ABiz Top 50 Luncheon held in the Cajundome Convention Center. Lessig’s message: money corrupts the electoral process and it’s past time for regular citizens to reclaim the power.

> Rubens is correct about the public’s disgust with the money virus that has infected our democracy. The cure won’t be easy, since, as the Times noted, Republican leaders such as Sen. Mitch McConnell and conservative legal scholars “deeply oppose’’ proposals that would restrict money in campaigns, “arguing that they are an infringement on free speech and healthy political competition.”

> "I'm fortunately picking this up at a point in time when America is really ripe to do something," Lessig says. "If I were doing this five years ago, there would be two orders of magnitude difference in the pickup from the very same message.

> Mayday and other PACS such as Every Voice— which will work the issue on the state level— is not seeking to restrict spending but rather promoting ways to prompt more small donors to enter the fray and in this way lessen the impact of big contributors.

>  Mayday PAC, which seeks to reform campaign finance by promoting candidates of either party who will support reform legislation to end the overwhelming influence of PAC money in U.S. elections, is faced with the challenge of walking a tightrope in choosing precisely which candidates it will support in 2014.

> In short, with its decision to back Iowa's Appel, Mayday has given liberals some reason to smile upon it. But then there's the little matter of Mayday's other Anointed One, New Hampshire Republican Jim Rubens.

> A second idea that Harvard Professor Lessig has put on the table has been by George W. Bush’s ethics czar, Richard Painter, which would be called the Taxation Only with Representation Act, which would give every voter a $200 voucher to fund small campaigns.



###[The Guardian:  The problem with the Koch brothers isn't their politics. It's their copycats](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jul/28/problem-koch-brothers-mega-donors)
>  According to Gallup, fully 50% of the country would support a federally funded campaign finance system with no private contributions whatsoever; 79% would vote for a law limiting contributions in some way.

> Lawrence Lessig – who launched Mayday Pac to blow up big money in politics by raising big money – just surpassed his initial fundraising goal of $5m by raking in $7.6m in small donations.

> With more than 50,000 contributors, the average donation works out to about $140. No matter what side you're on when it comes to campaign finance, this was a triumph of grassroots organizing, with small donations leading the way.

> First it has to convince people that campaign finance is an issue worth voting on at all. Then it has to persuade people to vote its way.

###[Roll Call Opinion: Reforms May Fade, but Voter Anger Won’t](http://blogs.rollcall.com/beltway-insiders/reforms-may-fade-but-voter-anger-wont/?dcz=)
> But the latest campaign finance push, however impractical or constitutionally suspect, has tapped a well of voter anger that politicians ignore at their peril. Public disgust with Congress, which according to Gallup now enjoys a record-low 7 percent approval rating

> Some campaign finance experts cast the uphill amendment drive as an ill-advised distraction from more pragmatic changes. Lessig’s Mayday PAC, for one, is focused not on amending the Constitution but on such changes as matching small-dollar donations with public funding



###[The Daily Beast: George Takei Sets Phasers to Reform](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/07/15/george-takei-sets-phasers-to-reform.html)

###[MSNBC: ‘Super PAC to end all super PACs’ rakes in donations](http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/lawrence-lessig-super-pac-rakes-donations)
> Lessig has stressed that the group is non-partisan, and its rhetoric calls out the corrupting influence of money on both parties. Still, given the difficulty of finding Republicans who are willing to commit to genuine campaign finance reform, it seems likely that Mayday would mostly support Democrats.



###[Huffington Post: Senate Dems Step Up to Take On Two Outrageous Supreme Court Decisions](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/pearl-korn/senate-dems-step-up-to-ta_b_5587186.html)

> Have we reached that point? Many think so.  A recent poll found 74% of Americans agree the broken political system needs to be fixed first.

> Lessig...met the first hurdle this week when he raised $12 million for his ‘PAC to end all PACS.’ Now he has to show the campaign can elect politicians who will effectively confront the problem. The plan is for the tactic to grow in the next election after testing it in 2014.

> Lessig, who has far less campaign experience than Rove, needs to win a lot more races while spending a lot less money than American Crossroads. And for his plan to work — for 2014 to be the proof of concept Lessig needs for the massive push he envisions in 2016 — he needs to win those races convincingly.



###[VOX: 68% of Americans think elections are rigged](http://www.vox.com/2014/7/14/5898365/68-of-americans-think-elections-are-rigged)

> “Eighty-six percent of all voters believe political leaders are more interested in protecting their power than in doing what’s right for the American people.

> Eighty-three percent believe the country is run by an alliance of incumbent politicians, media pundits, lobbyists, and other interests for their own gain.

> The candidates selected will need to take a position on hard issues, like the five outlined at reform.to, which provide concrete plans to create a small donor system for campaign financing: matching citizen contributions and providing voters with vouchers.

> Lessig explained that candidates will be held accountable by committing to co-sponsoring a reform on campaign finance. The reason, said Lessig, is “if you get a majority of members [of Congress] who sponsor a piece of legislation, you have a tool to leverage that legislation on the floor."



###[ON the Media (RADIO INTERIVEW): The Super PAC to End Super PACs](http://www.onthemedia.org/story/super-pac-end-super-pacs/)

> Long story short: the color of Mayday's small-online-donor money is distinctly blue. Actually, this may not be too surprising a result (though it's still worth quantifying): I suspect liberals today tend to feel persecuted by PACs, and probably for good reason, whereas conservatives tend to like rampant big-money-in-politics just fine, thank you very much.

> Money has the potential to commodify everything we value. It eats the human commons. Not only is its heedless pursuit wrecking the planet, it is devouring all that remains of American democracy.

> Pushing back against this possibility is MaydayPAC, founded by Harvard Law School professor, author and long-time activist Lawrence Lessig.



###[Motherboard: Five Candidates the Internet's Favorite Super PAC Should Spend Its Money On](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/five-candidates-the-internets-favorite-super-pac-should-spend-its-money-on)
> Mayday PAC explicitly says it wants to select five races that are tight enough so that it can claim that its campaign finance reform agenda made an impact. That's where things get tricky. For one thing, most Congressional races aren't even competitive, as Derek Willis notes at The Upshot, and the vast majority of incumbents win reelection. For another, campaign finance reform is not top-of-mind when most voters go to the polls...

> Lessig wants to change that.


###[Sacramento News and Review: Small money strikes back with the 99Rise movement](http://www.newsreview.com/sacramento/small-money-strikes-back-with/content?oid=14008309)

The inequalities of our economy, which we accept as necessary for capitalism, could become the standard of our democracy.

> The Mayday PAC (mayone.us) is a bold new experiment. Launched May 1, the first-round goal was to raise $1 million from ordinary Americans in one month. Nearly 13,000 individuals contributed more than $1 million in 13 days.

Of course, we don’t live in a single-party state that filters candidates for mock elections, but we do have a filter; a hidden primary where our influence is anything but equal. And Lessig, a Harvard law professor and former young Republican, explains how it works and what we can do about it.

In response, Lessig transformed his career, ending the work on Internet law that had made him famous and turning his sights on the impossible-seeming fight against money in politics.

> On this wrenching, fascinating episode of The Good Fight, Lessig tells his story, lays out his plan, and explains how Mayday emerged from the desperation Lessig felt after Aaron Swartz’s tragic suicide in 2013.

> In an irony-laden crowdsourcing venture called Mayday, web entrepreneurs including Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, Paypal co-founder Peter Thiel and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffmann are hoping to solve the “big money problem” in US politics.

> “In 2012, 132 Americans funded 60 per cent of the Super PAC money raised in that election cycle,” Lessig said. “That number will go up in 2014. Imagine it goes up by a factor of 250. Even then, the funders of these Super PACs will represent no more than .01 per cent of America.

Let’s not forget the industry’s role in some major super PACs, such as Mark Zuckerberg’s FWD.us. And Napster co-founder Sean Parker has been making large political donations for years.

###[Newsweek: Mayday PAC - The Super PAC Built to Destroy Super PACs](http://www.newsweek.com/new-super-pac-aims-bring-down-super-pacs-256003)
> According to Lessig, Silicon Valley is uniquely positioned to change the power of wealth in American politics. Unlike the finance or energy industries, Silicon Valley has yet to mature to the point where it seeks to boost profit through legislative reforms.

> In some sense, Mayday’s approach seems paradoxical: taking money from one major industry and pitting it against another (the devil you know, and all that). But as Lessig points out, Mayday isn’t aimed specifically at pro-Silicon Valley legislation, like that pertaining to visas or net neutrality. “That wouldn’t be a very principled or interesting PAC,” he says. “The only thing the Mayday PAC is trying to do is get legislation passed to change the way elections are funded.”

Lessig said, “members of Congress were like, ‘What the hell? Why am I here? I didn’t want to become a telemarkter.’”

> In fact, Lessig says this is why the latest Congress has been the most unproductive of our history, because while it is very difficult to pass legislation, it can be very easy to block it. The corruption doesn’t come in these legislators writing bills for their donors – that’s what lobbyists do – it is in their ability to block legislation their donors don’t like.

> The cost of the 2014 pilot was estimated at $12 million. And so on May 1, we launched an experiment to see whether we could raise money through a Kickstarter campaign for at least half. We set an initial goal of $1 million in 30 days. Insiders thought this was impossible, but with the help of 13,000 supporters, with a median contribution of just $50, we crossed the $1 million mark in 13, not 30, days.

> The story of how a young programmer named Aaron Swartz convinced celebrated academic Lawrence Lessig that no political progress could be made without first reforming campaign finance is now part of Silicon Valley lore. In May, Lessig launched a radical initiative to address the issue: MAYDAY, a SuperPAC that secured funding from two Silicon Valley billionaires in order to curtail the influence of big money.

> "It makes me sick to imagine the amount of time [presidential candidates] spend raising money, but the institutional [issue] we have to do something about quite dramatically is Congress. Because Congress is increasingly an institution that spends all of its time in the business of raising money as opposed to the business of trying to figure out what the right thing to do is."



###[Policy Innovations: Of Moonshots and Slingshots](http://www.policyinnovations.org/ideas/commentary/data/000282)
> Is it still possible for a government to move against the market to favor society? The May Day PAC established by Lawrence Lessig takes the stance that U.S. electoral politics are entirely controlled by corporate interests due to the realities of campaign financing: Politicians who do not attract lavish spending by corporations and wealthy individuals simply cannot succeed under the current rules.

> The situation may be considerably more complex than that (the Republican-Democrat split in America is as much cultural as political), but legitimate questions can certainly be asked about the ability of the U.S. government to go against U.S. business interests.

> This is the fair but hard question raised by the strategy planned by Senate Democrats this summer to force a vote on New Mexico Senator Tom Udall’s proposed constitutional amendment to give Congress the power “to regulate the raising and spending of money” in elections. Forty-three Senate Democrats have cosponsored the resolution. Zero Republicans have. Zero is the same number of Republicans who have joined any of the proposed constitutional amendments now floating about in Congress to, as they are described, “reverse Citizens United.”

> This week, Salon called up Lessig in order to discuss some of the details of the Mayday PAC and the vexing problem of money and democracy in America more generally. We also touched on Eric Cantor’s recent shocking defeat and how inequality causes political polarization. Our conversation is below and has been edited for clarity and length.

> The aim of the super PAC is to win a Congress committed to fundamental reform by 2016. Fundamental reform in the way elections are funded. To do that, we want to run a pilot in 2014 in five districts to demonstrate that this issue matters to voters and to put Congress on notice in 2016 that we’ll be back in a much bigger way.

###[Seacoast Online: We voters have more power than we realize](http://www.seacoastonline.com/articles/20140614-OPINION-406140305)
> Be encouraged! Even though 96 percent of voters agree that money is a problem in politics (they're right), 91 percent don't believe it can be fixed (they're wrong). We voters have more power than we think we do! On Tuesday, a congressional primary race in Virginia was won by a newcomer to politics who raised just over $200,000 for his campaign. His losing opponent (the incumbent) raised over $5 million.

> In his book "Republic, Lost: How Money Corrupts Congress — and a Plan to Stop It," Lawrence Lessig proposes nonpartisan plans to end it. It's a 300-page book, but let me wet your appetite with one paragraph from page 266. "First, we convert the first $50 dollars that each of us contributes to the Federal Treasury into a voucher. Call it a 'democracy voucher.' Each voter is free to allocate his or her democracy voucher as he or she wishes. Maybe $50 to a single candidate. Maybe $25 each to two candidates. Maybe $10 each to five candidates. The only requirement is that the candidate receiving the voucher must opt into the system.

I'm not talking about "money exchanged under the table" corruption, but rather what Harvard Professor Larry Lessig terms "dependence corruption" -- the totally legal dependence that our elected officials have upon the powerful interests that make (and, crucially, break) their campaigns.

> This is the cold, hard reality: Any member of Congress who supports gun control legislation today faces a tidal wave of NRA money aimed squarely at kicking them out of office. In the 2012 federal election cycle, the NRA spent nearly $20 million to defeat politicians -- both Democrats and Republicans -- who voted in favor of gun regulations, and to elect politicians who championed unfettered access to guns.

> Larry Lessig's MAYDAY.US. And, yes, we already wrote about this at the beginning of May when the first phase launched, and again when it hit the $1 million goal -- and then secured the second million in matching funds. However, the project has now moved into phase two, where the goal is to raise (and match) $5 million, instead of just $1 million. Already it's around half a million dollars, so there's a long way to go, but it's a good start.

> And, once again, the goal here is to raise this total of $12 million ($1 million + $1 million match in May, and then $5 million + $5 million match in June) as a test for a much larger effort. I've seen too many overly cynical folks say "$12 million isn't enough to change politics." And you're right. But that's not the goal. This is $12 million to be used in specific races as a proof of concept for a much larger moonshot.

The performance is a benefit for Mayday PAC, a group begun by Lessig and GOP media strategist Mark McKinnon in hopes of raising $12 million that could be used to target candidates opposed to inhibiting the political influence of wealthy donors.

> Palmer, who has a wildly devoted following, used the crowd-funding website Kickstarter to raise $1.2 million to finance her last CD and tour. Mayday PAC already has some deep-pocketed patrons, including TED curator Chris Anderson, LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, and Brad Burnham, managing partner of Union Square Ventures, which has funded the likes of Twitter, Kickstarter, and Tumblr.

> “Impossible.” As the Army used to say, “The difficult we do immediately, the impossible takes a little longer.” And while we’re not opposed to impossible campaigns, we believe it critical that this movement to “restore democracy” also try the merely “difficult.” For long before two-thirds of Congress will propose an amendment to the Constitution and three-quarters of the states will ratify it, Congress could radically change the way campaigns are funded, through a simple majority vote.

> This is the hard work that Congress should do. It’s easy to hold hearings on resolutions that everyone knows will fail. It takes leadership to force debate on ideas that no one believes can pass—but must pass. That’s the leadership that Lyndon Johnson demonstrated, both in the Senate in 1957, and as President, when he forced a reluctant South to finally accept equal rights. That’s the leadership that this nation needs again, but that, in the grandstanding of D.C. partisanship, seems truly “impossible.”

And for SuperPACs, the numbers are even tinier. In the 2012 election cycle, 132 Americans contributed 60 percent of the SuperPAC money spent in all races. Congress has become dependent upon this tiny slice of the 1 percent, but in no conceivable way does this tiny fraction represent America.”

> There’s too much money in politics, right? Lawrence Lessig has a new plan to solve an old problem. He wants to end money’s outsize influence on the political process, which subverts democracy and drowns out the masses to do the bidding of the well-to-do few.

> Campaign finance reform comes down to arguing about who gets to decide who gets to be umpire of a game which is, at its core, rigged. And it’s rigged in favor of the rich. Electoral politics is mostly cage matches in the gladiator arena they use to distract us. It’s the circus, and entitlements are the bread.

This problem is not new, but what had been a tide is becoming a flood. With each campaign, our elected officials grow more dependent on big donations from special interests and less dependent on us, their constituents.

> We’ve reached a tipping point for reform. The Great Recession that began in 2007 exposed government and private institutions as deeply flawed and unable to protect ordinary people. The Supreme Court, contrary to common sense and the beliefs of most Americans, has declared that corporations are people and that enormous spending by a billionaire on politics is speech legally equivalent to actual speech by an ordinary citizen.

> Lessig and other leaders of this fight acknowledge it is a tough one. But they have reminded me that when millions of Americans across the political spectrum get riled up and demand change, Congress will listen and will act, and in due course, so will the Supreme Court.

> If successful, Mayday PAC would go from inception to a war chest of over $12 million in just 60 days. That money will then fund campaigns in five congressional districts yet to be announced, targeting candidates that oppose campaign finance reform. It is part of a two election cycle plan to hold candidates accountable to voters on the issue of money in politics and win a Congress committed to enacting campaign finance reform by 2016. If successful in the 2014 cycle, the effort would be expanded for the 2016 elections.

> This experimental new effort will show that regular people are deeply motivated to demand changes that loosen the grip of big money on politics and government. People “commit” by pledging a contribution anywhere between $5 and $10,000, and their commitment is collected only if the Mayday PAC reaches its fundraising target by its deadline.

> "The influence of big money over our political process is worse than it's ever been, and it's evident from the complete dysfunction in Washington," said Professor Lawrence Lessig. "Mayday PAC's success will prove that there are enough people willing to invest in sending Congress the message that it is time for fundamental campaign finance reform." Mark McKinnon adds, "We want a government that works for all of us, not simply the wealthy who bankroll campaign contributions and Super PACs."

> This experimental new effort will show that regular people are deeply motivated to demand changes that loosen the grip of big money on politics and government. People "commit" by pledging a contribution anywhere between $5 and $10,000, and their commitment is collected only if the Mayday PAC reaches its fundraising target by its deadline.

> The Mayday PAC, launched on May 1, announced a crowd funding plan to raise $12 million to back supporters of publicly financed elections in 2014. If people help raise $1 million, with contributions of $10,000 or less, in one month, Lessig said wealthy supporters would kick in another $1 million. The group raised its first $1 million by the middle of May.

> The big supporters providing the matching $1 million include LinkedIn CEO Reid Hoffman, venture capitalist and PayPal co-founder and president of Thiel Capital Peter Thiel, TED curator Chris Anderson, Union Square Ventures partners Brad Burnham and Fred Wilson, Women's Entrepreneurial Festival co-founder Joanne Wilson, and Schooner Capital founder Vin Ryan.

The vast majority link that failure to the influence of money in politics. Yet more than 90 percent of us don’t see how that influence could be reduced. Washington won’t fix itself, so who else could fix it?

> It turns out the framers of our Constitution thought about this problem precisely. Two days before the Constitution was complete, they noticed a bug. In the version they were considering, only Congress could propose amendments to the Constitution. That led Virginia’s George Mason to ask, what if Congress itself was the problem?

> “In 2016, number one, there will be fewer fights that we have to have, because people will get on the right side of this issue just out of fear,” Lessig says. “And number two, we’ll have a whole bunch of people more interested in investing, because they see a potential return here.”

> “[Vouchers] would radically change the business model of fundraising overnight,” Lessig says. “You would not have candidates spending their time talking to the tiniest fraction of the 1%. They’d be thinking about the ways to attract a wide range of contributions from everybody who has a voucher.”

>  Is it possible to create a "super PAC" that would end the power of super PACs by drawing enough Americans into the system to limit the influence of big money in politics? And is it possible to get voters excited about a subject as dry as campaign finance?  Harvard law professor Lawrence Lessig is leading a crusade to answer both those questions with a yes.

>  If the Mayday PAC is able to take out five members of Congress this cycle “who are on the wrong side of this issue,” Lessig said, “then when 2016 comes around, magically a whole bunch of members of Congress would be on the right side of this issue, and we would have a narrower range of people that we would have to be going after, and we would have very good data

> WASHINGTON -- On May 1, Harvard professor Lawrence Lessig launched what he calls
  a "super PAC to end all super PACs."  Lessig, one of a new breed of campaign
  finance reformers, wants to change the corrupted system by which politicians
  now raise money for their campaigns.

> The irony is to get money out of politics, reformers must raise money of their own.
  On that measure, Lessig's new     organization has gotten off to a super start.

  central issue in 2016. With a little luck, the Harvard law professor’s idea
  could help save the republic.

> Harvard’s Lawrence Lessig, the crusader for campaign finance reform, feels
  that his fellow reformers don’t think big or boldly enough to inspire the kind
  of grassroots campaign that might break elite donors’ stranglehold on
  America’s political system.

> In a recent piece in [*The
  Atlantic*](http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/04/campaign-finance-and-the-nihilist-politics-of-resignation/360437/),
  Lessig argues that public cynicism about the prospect of deep reform actually
  working is the only thing keeping widespread outrage at our slide toward
  plutocracy in check. And he thinks that only a “moonshot” campaign — an
  ambitious, collective, national effort “unlike anything they’ve seen before” —
  can “crack this cynicism” and usher in a more democratic system.

> Mayday PAC was already 8 percent of the way toward its goal by Thursday
  afternoon with more than $75,000 pledged and nearly 31 days left to reach its
  target.

> To say Mayday PAC faces an uphill fight is an understatement. Proponents of
  serious campaign finance reform face strong opponents in both parties, and the
  Supreme Court and lower courts have issued rulings in recent years striking
  down or throwing into doubt a wide array of restrictions on political
  spending.

> If the idea behind Mayday PAC sounds absurd, that’s by design. Cynicism and
  defeatism about government run so deep through American politics, Lessig
  believes, that the only way to “crack this cynicism” is with an idea so
  exceedingly ambitious—a “moonshoot,” he calls it—that people might be roused
  to get behind it.
