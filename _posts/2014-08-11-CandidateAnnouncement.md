# Campaign Will Now Target Eight Total Races, Including Three Candidates Announced Today. First Radio Ads to Air in New Hampshire.

WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Mayday PAC expands their number of targeted races from five to eight. Mayday PAC will increase its campaign spending due to better than expected fundraising and broad citizen support. The additional three targets will be announced once field teams and campaigners are in place.

In addition, today Mayday PAC announces three more of the eight total candidates it will support: Walter Jones (R, NC-3), Carol Shea-Porter (D, NH-1) and Ruben Gallego, Democratic candidate in Arizona’s seventh congressional district to replace retiring Congressman Ed Pastor.

With this announcement, Mayday PAC continues to meet its commitment to work with candidates who support reform on both sides of the aisle. Mayday PAC will be communicating directly with voters in these districts with specific messages on political cronyism and reform. Mayday PAC will be working to make changing the way elections are funded a fundamental issue in each of these races.

A fact sheet and additional information on each candidate’s record on reform can be found [here](https://mayday.us/factsheet).

Today Mayday PAC also announces the placement of its first radio ads in New Hampshire, in support of Senate candidate Jim Rubens. These ads make it clear to voters that the only way to reclaim our democracy and get government working again is to reduce money in politics. These ads can be found [here](https://mayday.us/rubens/#radioAds).

"Today we’re taking several big steps in Mayday’s plan to retake our Democracy. All eight of our candidates are leaders on reform and, when elected to Congress, they will help us reach our goal of electing a Congress to pass fundamental reform of the way elections are funded by 2016," said Lawrence Lessig, Mayday PAC co-founder with Mark McKinnon, Republican strategist.

"For both Republicans and Democrats, reform is a winning issue. Our expansion to eight targets is both a testament to successful citizen-up fundraising and evidence of this movement’s broad support," added McKinnon.

###Which Candidates Will Fight Back Against Big Money in Politics?

__Mayday PAC supports Republican Walter Jones, NC-3 House general election:__

Republican Congressman Walter Jones prevailed over his most competitive challenge to date in the NC-3 Republican primary — his opponent was largely funded by outside money. He is now running against Marshall Adame, a retired Marine and former U.S. diplomat, in the general election. Jones has represented the third district for 10 terms.

FACTS: Congressman Walter Jones is the [only Republican](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/04/23/walter-jones-taylor-griffin_n_5187262.html) House member who vocally supports changing the way elections are funded. He [called](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R13_Ud0rSQw) [Citizens United](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R13_Ud0rSQw) "one of the worst decisions by the Supreme Court in my adult lifetime." Jones is proof that campaign finance reform is an issue that gains [traction on both sides of the aisle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R13_Ud0rSQw).

FACTS: Congressman Jones is an original co-sponsor of the [Government By the People Act](http://www.publicampaign.org/blog/2014/02/21/republican-walter-jones-supports-government-people-act). Jones’ history of sponsoring legislation to get money out of politics includes the [Fair Elections Now Act](http://action.fairelectionsnow.org/fairelections) from 2008, which was reintroduced in the House in 2011. In 2013, he introduced H.R. 3466 or [No Political Funds for Personal Use](https://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/3466), a bill that would close the personal use loophole for all [political committees](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/22/republican-campaign-finance-reform_n_4324754.html).

__Mayday PAC supports Democrat Carol Shea-Porter, NH-1 House general election:__

Democrat Congresswoman Carol Shea-Porter is running against Frank Guinta, the former incumbent who lost to Shea-Porter in 2012. The race has been rated as a "toss-up" by most major news organizations.

FACTS: Congresswoman Shea-Porter co-sponsored the [Government By the People Act](http://www.ontheissues.org/house/Carol_Shea-Porter_Government_Reform.htm). In addition, campaign finance reform is a cornerstone of her [re-election campaign](http://www.sheaporter.com/Issues/2012-08-campaign-finance-reform). Shea-Porter is a co-sponsor of the [Fair Elections Now Act](https://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/269/cosponsors) and participated in the ["New Hampshire Rebellion"](http://blog.ted.com/2014/01/24/larry-lessig-completes-185-mile-walk-across-new-hampshire/) protest in 2014.

FACTS: Guinta was named one of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington’s [Most Corrupt](http://www.crewsmostcorrupt.org/mostcorrupt/entry/frank-guinta) members of congress during his first term. He was [placed under federal investigation](http://www.citizensforethics.org/page/-/PDFs/Reports/Most Corrupt Reports/Guinta, Frank.pdf?nocdn=1) for irregularities in his 2010 campaign finances. In 2012, Guinta’s top donors included [Citizens United and Koch Industries](https://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/contrib.php?cycle=2012&cid=N00030801).

__Mayday PAC supports Democrat Ruben Gallego, AZ-7 primary election:__

Democrat Ruben Gallego is a former Arizona state representative running against Mary Rose Wilcox, the Maricopa County Supervisor. The district is currently represented by retiring democratic congressman Ed Pastor.

FACTS: Gallego believes that the only way to get Washington working again is to take money out of politics. [He supports](http://gallegoforarizona.com/money-in-politics/) the Government by the People Act and a constitutional amendment that would overturn the Citizens United decision.

FACTS: Gallego has received several high profile endorsements, including current Rep. Raul Grijalva (D-Ariz) who has received praise from the [Fair Elections Now Coalition](http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/fair-elections-now-coalition-praises-rep-raul-grijalva-for-cosponsoring-fair-elections-now-act-60778672.html) for co-sponsoring the Fair Elections Now Act. Grijalva endorsed Gallego in a [written statement](http://www.politico.com/story/2014/03/raul-grijalva-arizona-2014-primary-104818.html#ixzz39ofR6WmW), saying "I worked with Ed Pastor for many years. He was the best partner I could have asked for in Phoenix, and I couldn’t think of a better candidate to replace him than Ruben Gallego."
